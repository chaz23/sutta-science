mn2:1.1	So I have heard.	mn2	1	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn2	1	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn2	1	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn2	1	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn2	1	5	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn2	1	6	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilements.	mn2	2	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn2	2	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn2	2	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:2.4	The Buddha said this:	mn2	2	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:3.1	“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.	mn2	3	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:3.2	For one who knows and sees what?	mn2	3	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:3.3	Rational application of mind and irrational application of mind.	mn2	3	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:3.4	When you apply the mind irrationally, defilements arise, and once arisen they grow.	mn2	3	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:3.5	When you apply the mind rationally, defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up.	mn2	3	5	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:4.1	Some defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.	mn2	4	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:5.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by seeing?	mn2	5	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:5.2	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn2	5	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:5.3	They don’t understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.	mn2	5	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:5.4	So they apply the mind to things they shouldn’t and don’t apply the mind to things they should.	mn2	5	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:6.1	And what are the things to which they apply the mind but should not?	mn2	6	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:6.2	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,	mn2	6	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:6.3	desire to be reborn,	mn2	6	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:6.4	and ignorance.	mn2	6	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:6.5	These are the things to which they apply the mind but should not.	mn2	6	5	mn	2	All the Defilements

mn2:6.10	These are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should.	mn2	6	10	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.1	Because of applying the mind to what they should not and not applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements grow.	mn2	7	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.2	This is how they apply the mind irrationally:	mn2	7	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.3	‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?	mn2	7	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.4	Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’	mn2	7	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.5	Or they are undecided about the present thus:	mn2	7	5	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:7.6	‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’	mn2	7	6	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.1	When they apply the mind irrationally in this way, one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine fact.	mn2	8	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.2	The view: ‘My self survives.’	mn2	8	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.3	The view: ‘My self does not survive.’	mn2	8	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.4	The view: ‘I perceive the self with the self.’	mn2	8	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.5	The view: ‘I perceive what is not-self with the self.’	mn2	8	5	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.6	The view: ‘I perceive the self with what is not-self.’	mn2	8	6	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.7	Or they have such a view:	mn2	8	7	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.8	‘This self of mine is he, the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	mn2	8	8	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.9	This is called a misconception, the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views.	mn2	8	9	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.10	An unlearned ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn2	8	10	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:8.11	They’re not freed from suffering, I say.	mn2	8	11	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:9.2	But take a learned noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn2	9	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:9.3	They understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind.	mn2	9	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:9.4	So they apply the mind to things they should and don’t apply the mind to things they shouldn’t.	mn2	9	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.1	And what are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not?	mn2	10	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.2	They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire,	mn2	10	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.3	desire to be reborn,	mn2	10	3	mn	2	All the Defilements

mn2:10.8	desire to be reborn,	mn2	10	8	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.9	and ignorance.	mn2	10	9	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.10	These are the things to which they do apply the mind and should.	mn2	10	10	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:10.11	Because of not applying the mind to what they should not and applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements don’t arise and arisen defilements are given up.	mn2	10	11	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:11.1	They rationally apply the mind: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn2	11	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:11.2	And as they do so, they give up three fetters:	mn2	11	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:11.3	substantialist view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.	mn2	11	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:11.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by seeing.	mn2	11	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:12.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint?	mn2	12	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:12.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, lives restraining the faculty of the eye.	mn2	12	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:12.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.	mn2	12	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:12.4	Reflecting rationally, they live restraining the faculty of the ear …	mn2	12	4	mn	2	All the Defilements

mn2:12.6	the tongue …	mn2	12	6	mn	2	All the Defilements

mn2:12.11	These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.	mn2	12	11	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:13.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by using?	mn2	13	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:13.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, makes use of robes:	mn2	13	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:13.3	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’	mn2	13	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:14.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of almsfood:	mn2	14	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:14.2	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	mn2	14	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:15.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of lodgings:	mn2	15	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:15.2	‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’	mn2	15	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:16.1	Reflecting rationally, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick:	mn2	16	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:16.2	‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’	mn2	16	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:17.1	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used.	mn2	17	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:17.2	These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.	mn2	17	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:18.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring?	mn2	18	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:18.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.	mn2	18	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:18.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured.	mn2	18	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:18.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.	mn2	18	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:19.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding?	mn2	19	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:19.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer.	mn2	19	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:19.3	Reflecting rationally, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.	mn2	19	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:19.4	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided.	mn2	19	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:19.5	These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.	mn2	19	5	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:20.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by dispelling?	mn2	20	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:20.2	Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.	mn2	20	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:20.3	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelled.	mn2	20	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:20.4	These are called the defilements that should be given up by dispelling.	mn2	20	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.1	And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing?	mn2	21	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.2	It’s when a mendicant, reflecting rationally, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,	mn2	21	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.3	investigation of principles,	mn2	21	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.4	energy,	mn2	21	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.5	rapture,	mn2	21	5	mn	2	All the Defilements

mn2:21.7	immersion,	mn2	21	7	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.8	and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.	mn2	21	8	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.9	For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed.	mn2	21	9	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:21.10	These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.	mn2	21	10	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:22.1	Now, take a mendicant who, by seeing, has given up the defilements that should be given up by seeing. By restraint, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By dispelling, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by dispelling. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.	mn2	22	1	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:22.2	They’re called a mendicant who lives having restrained all defilements, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”	mn2	22	2	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:22.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn2	22	3	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn2:22.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn2	22	4	mn	2	All the Defilements
mn3:1.1	So I have heard.	mn3	1	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn3	1	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn3	1	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn3	1	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn3	1	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn3	1	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.1	“Mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	mn3	2	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.2	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	mn3	2	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.3	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’	mn3	2	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.4	If you become heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching, that will make you liable to the accusation:	mn3	2	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.5	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’	mn3	2	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.6	And it will make me liable to the accusation:	mn3	2	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.7	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in things of the flesh, not in the teaching.’	mn3	2	7	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.8	If you become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh, that will make you not liable to the accusation:	mn3	2	8	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.9	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’	mn3	2	9	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.10	And it will make me not liable to the accusation:	mn3	2	10	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.11	‘The Teacher’s disciples live as heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.’	mn3	2	11	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.12	So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	mn3	2	12	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.13	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	mn3	2	13	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:2.14	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’	mn3	2	14	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.1	Suppose that I had eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I needed.	mn3	3	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.2	And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away.	mn3	3	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.3	Then two mendicants were to come who were weak with hunger.	mn3	3	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.4	I’d say to them,	mn3	3	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.5	‘Mendicants, I have eaten and refused more food, being full, and having had as much as I need.	mn3	3	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.6	And there is this extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	mn3	3	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.7	Eat it if you like. Otherwise I’ll throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.’	mn3	3	7	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.8	Then one of those mendicants thought,	mn3	3	8	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.9	‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.	mn3	3	9	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.10	And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	mn3	3	10	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.11	If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.	mn3	3	11	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.12	But the Buddha has also said:	mn3	3	12	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.13	“Be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.”	mn3	3	13	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.14	And almsfood is one of the things of the flesh.	mn3	3	14	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.15	Instead of eating this almsfood, why don’t I spend this day and night weak with hunger?’	mn3	3	15	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.16	And that’s what they did.	mn3	3	16	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.17	Then the second of those mendicants thought,	mn3	3	17	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.18	‘The Buddha has eaten and refused more food.	mn3	3	18	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.19	And he has some extra almsfood that’s going to be thrown away.	mn3	3	19	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.20	If we don’t eat it he’ll throw it away.	mn3	3	20	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.21	Why don’t I eat this almsfood, then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weakness?’	mn3	3	21	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.22	And that’s what they did.	mn3	3	22	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.23	Even though that mendicant, after eating the almsfood, spent the day and night rid of hunger and weakness, it is the former mendicant who is more worthy of respect and praise.	mn3	3	23	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.24	Why is that?	mn3	3	24	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.25	Because for a long time that will conduce to that mendicant being of few wishes, content, self-effacing, unburdensome, and energetic.	mn3	3	25	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.26	So, mendicants, be my heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	mn3	3	26	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.27	Out of sympathy for you, I think,	mn3	3	27	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:3.28	‘How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh?’”	mn3	3	28	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn3	4	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	mn3	4	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.3	Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,	mn3	4	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	mn3	4	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	mn3	4	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:4.6	Sāriputta said this:	mn3	4	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.1	“Reverends, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion? And how do they train in seclusion?”	mn3	5	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.2	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.	mn3	5	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.3	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.	mn3	5	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.4	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn3	5	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.5	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn3	5	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn3	5	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:5.7	Sāriputta said this:	mn3	5	7	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.1	“Reverends, how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion?	mn3	6	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.2	The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.	mn3	6	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.3	They don’t give up what the Teacher tells them to give up.	mn3	6	3	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.4	They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion.	mn3	6	4	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.5	In this case, the senior mendicants should be criticized on three grounds.	mn3	6	5	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.6	‘The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.’	mn3	6	6	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.7	This is the first ground.	mn3	6	7	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.8	‘They don’t give up what the Teacher tells them to give up.’	mn3	6	8	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching

mn3:6.11	This is the third ground.	mn3	6	11	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.12	The senior mendicants should be criticized on these three grounds.	mn3	6	12	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.13	In this case, the middle mendicants	mn3	6	13	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.14	and the junior mendicants should be criticized on the same three grounds.	mn3	6	14	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:6.22	This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.	mn3	6	22	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:7.1	And how do the disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion?	mn3	7	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:7.2	The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion.	mn3	7	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching

mn3:7.22	This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion.	mn3	7	22	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:8.1	The bad thing here is greed and hate.	mn3	8	1	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching
mn3:8.2	There is a middle way of practice for giving up greed and hate. It gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.	mn3	8	2	mn	3	Heirs in the Teaching

mn4:1.1	So I have heard.	mn4	1	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn4	1	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.1	Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn4	2	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn4	2	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.3	“Worthy Gotama, those gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in you have the worthy Gotama to lead the way, help them out, and give them encouragement.	mn4	2	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.4	And those people follow the worthy Gotama’s example.”	mn4	2	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.5	“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!”	mn4	2	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.8	“But worthy Gotama, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.	mn4	2	8	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.9	The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.”	mn4	2	9	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:2.10	“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!	mn4	2	10	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:3.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,	mn4	3	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:3.2	‘Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude.	mn4	3	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:3.3	The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.’	mn4	3	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.1	Then I thought,	mn4	4	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conduct.	mn4	4	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.3	But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind.	mn4	4	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.4	My conduct is purified.	mn4	4	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.5	I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body, speech, and mind.’	mn4	4	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:4.6	Seeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.	mn4	4	6	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:5.1	Then I thought,	mn4	5	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:5.4	‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their livelihood.	mn4	5	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread

mn4:7.2	Seeing this purity of livelihood in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.	mn4	7	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:8.1	Then I thought,	mn4	8	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:8.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins full of desire for sensual pleasures, with acute lust …	mn4	8	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread

mn4:11.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless, with no peace of mind …	mn4	11	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:11.4	My mind is peaceful …’	mn4	11	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:12.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain …	mn4	12	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:12.4	I’ve gone beyond doubt …’	mn4	12	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:13.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who glorify themselves and put others down …	mn4	13	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:13.4	I don’t glorify myself and put others down …’	mn4	13	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:14.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and craven …	mn4	14	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:14.4	I don’t get startled …’	mn4	14	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:15.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity …	mn4	15	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:15.4	I have few wishes …’	mn4	15	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:16.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack energy …	mn4	16	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:16.4	I am energetic …’	mn4	16	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:17.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful and lack situational awareness …	mn4	17	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:17.4	I am mindful …’	mn4	17	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:18.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who lack immersion, with straying minds …	mn4	18	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:18.4	I am accomplished in immersion …’	mn4	18	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:19.2	‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and idiotic who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of the defects of witlessness and stupidity.	mn4	19	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:19.3	But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest witless and idiotic.	mn4	19	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:19.4	I am accomplished in wisdom.	mn4	19	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:19.5	I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest accomplished in wisdom.’	mn4	19	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:19.6	Seeing this accomplishment of wisdom in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.	mn4	19	6	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.1	Then I thought,	mn4	20	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.2	‘There are certain nights that are recognized as specially portentous:	mn4	20	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.3	the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.	mn4	20	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.4	On such nights, why don’t I stay in awe-inspiring and hair-raising shrines in parks, forests, and trees? In such lodgings, hopefully I might see that fear and dread.’	mn4	20	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.5	Some time later, that’s what I did.	mn4	20	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.8	As I was staying there a deer came by, or a peacock snapped a twig, or the wind rustled the leaves.	mn4	20	8	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.9	Then I thought,	mn4	20	9	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.10	‘Is this that fear and dread coming?’	mn4	20	10	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.11	Then I thought,	mn4	20	11	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.12	‘Why do I always meditate expecting that fear to come?	mn4	20	12	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.13	Why don’t I get rid of that fear and dread just as it comes, while remaining just as I am?’	mn4	20	13	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.14	Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was walking.	mn4	20	14	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.15	I didn’t stand still or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while walking.	mn4	20	15	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.16	Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was standing.	mn4	20	16	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.17	I didn’t walk or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while standing.	mn4	20	17	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.18	Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was sitting.	mn4	20	18	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.19	I didn’t lie down or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while sitting.	mn4	20	19	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.20	Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was lying down.	mn4	20	20	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:20.21	I didn’t sit up or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while lying down.	mn4	20	21	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:21.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it’s day when in fact it’s night, or perceive that it’s night when in fact it’s day.	mn4	21	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:21.2	This meditation of theirs is delusional, I say.	mn4	21	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:21.3	I perceive that it’s night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it’s day when in fact it is day.	mn4	21	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:21.4	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	mn4	21	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:21.5	a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.	mn4	21	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:22-26.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi and unified.	mn4	22-26	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:22-26.2	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn4	22-26	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:22-26.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn4	22-26	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:22-26.4	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn4	22-26	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:22-26.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn4	22-26	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:27.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives.	mn4	27	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:27.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn4	27	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:28.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	mn4	28	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:28.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn4	28	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:29.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn4	29	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:29.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn4	29	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:30.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	mn4	30	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:30.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn4	30	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:31.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn4	31	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:31.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn4	31	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:31.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn4	31	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:32.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn4	32	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:32.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	mn4	32	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:32.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	mn4	32	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:33.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night.	mn4	33	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:33.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn4	33	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:34.1	Brahmin, you might think:	mn4	34	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:34.2	‘Perhaps the ascetic Gotama is not free of greed, hate, and delusion even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’	mn4	34	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:34.3	But you should not see it like this.	mn4	34	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:34.4	I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.	mn4	34	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:34.5	I see happiness for myself in this life, and I have sympathy for future generations.”	mn4	34	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:35.1	“Indeed, worthy Gotama has sympathy for future generations, since he is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn4	35	1	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:35.2	Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent, worthy Gotama!	mn4	35	2	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:35.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn4	35	3	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:35.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn4	35	4	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn4:35.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn4	35	5	mn	4	Fear and Dread
mn5:1.1	So I have heard.	mn5	1	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn5	1	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:	mn5	1	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	mn5	1	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	mn5	1	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	mn5	1	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.1	“Reverends, these four people are found in the world.	mn5	2	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.2	What four?	mn5	2	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.3	One person with a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’	mn5	2	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.4	But another person with a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’	mn5	2	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.5	One person without a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’	mn5	2	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.6	But another person without a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’	mn5	2	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.7	In this case, of the two persons with a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,	mn5	2	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.8	while the one who does understand is better.	mn5	2	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.9	And of the two persons without a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse,	mn5	2	9	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:2.10	while the one who does understand is better.”	mn5	2	10	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him:	mn5	3	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:3.2	“What is the cause, Reverend Sāriputta, what is the reason why, of the two persons with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?	mn5	3	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:3.3	And what is the cause, what is the reason why, of the two persons without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?”	mn5	3	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.1	“Reverends, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t generate enthusiasm, make an effort, or rouse up energy to give up that blemish.	mn5	4	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.2	And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind.	mn5	4	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.3	Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains.	mn5	4	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.4	And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place.	mn5	4	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.5	Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get even dirtier and more stained?”	mn5	4	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.6	“Yes, reverend.”	mn5	4	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.7	“In the same way, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that …	mn5	4	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:4.8	they will die with a corrupted mind.	mn5	4	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.1	Take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they will generate enthusiasm, make an effort, and rouse up energy to give up that blemish.	mn5	5	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.2	And they will die without greed, hate, and delusion, unblemished, with an uncorrupted mind.	mn5	5	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.3	Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains.	mn5	5	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.4	But the owners used it and had it cleaned, and didn’t keep it in a dirty place.	mn5	5	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.5	Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get cleaner and brighter?”	mn5	5	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.6	“Yes, reverend.”	mn5	5	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.7	“In the same way, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that …	mn5	5	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:5.8	they will die with an uncorrupted mind.	mn5	5	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.1	Take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish but does not understand it. You can expect that they will focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust will infect their mind.	mn5	6	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.2	And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind.	mn5	6	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.3	Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright.	mn5	6	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.4	And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place.	mn5	6	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.5	Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get dirtier and more stained?”	mn5	6	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.6	“Yes, reverend.”	mn5	6	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.7	“In the same way, take the case of the person who has no blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that …	mn5	6	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:6.8	they will die with a corrupted mind.	mn5	6	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:7.1	Take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they won’t focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust won’t infect their mind.	mn5	7	1	mn	5	Unblemished

mn5:7.7	“In the same way, take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that …	mn5	7	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:7.8	they will die with an uncorrupted mind.	mn5	7	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:8.1	This is the cause, this is the reason why, of the two persons with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better.	mn5	8	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:8.2	And this is the cause, this is the reason why, of the two persons without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better.”	mn5	8	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:9.1	“Reverend, the word ‘blemish’ is spoken of.	mn5	9	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:9.2	But what is ‘blemish’ a term for?”	mn5	9	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:9.3	“Reverend, ‘blemish’ is a term for the spheres of bad, unskillful wishes.	mn5	9	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:10.1	It’s possible that some mendicant might wish:	mn5	10	1	mn	5	Unblemished

mn5:26-27.8	And that anger and that bitterness	mn5	26-27	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:26-27.9	are both blemishes.	mn5	26-27	9	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:28.1	‘Blemish’ is a term for these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes.	mn5	28	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.1	Suppose these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant. Even though they dwell in the wilderness, in remote lodgings, eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, wear rag robes, and wear shabby robes, their spiritual companions don’t honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.	mn5	29	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.2	Why is that?	mn5	29	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.3	It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable.	mn5	29	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.4	Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright.	mn5	29	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.5	The owners were to prepare it with the carcass of a snake, a dog, or a human, cover it with a bronze lid, and parade it through the market-place.	mn5	29	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.6	When people saw it they’d say:	mn5	29	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.7	‘My good man, what is it that you’re carrying like a precious treasure?’	mn5	29	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.8	So they’d open up the lid for people to look inside.	mn5	29	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.9	But as soon as they saw it they were filled with loathing, revulsion, and disgust.	mn5	29	9	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.10	Not even those who were hungry wanted to eat it, let alone those who had eaten.	mn5	29	10	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.11	In the same way, when these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant … their spiritual companions don’t honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.	mn5	29	11	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.12	Why is that?	mn5	29	12	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:29.13	It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable.	mn5	29	13	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.1	Suppose these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant. Even though they dwell within a village, accept invitations to a meal, and wear robes offered by householders, their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.	mn5	30	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.2	Why is that?	mn5	30	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.3	It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable.	mn5	30	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.4	Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright.	mn5	30	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.5	The owners were to prepare it with boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, cover it with a bronze lid, and parade it through the market-place.	mn5	30	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.6	When people saw it they’d say:	mn5	30	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.7	‘My good man, what is it that you’re carrying like a precious treasure?’	mn5	30	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.8	So they’d open up the lid for people to look inside.	mn5	30	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.9	And as soon as they saw it they were filled with liking, attraction, and relish.	mn5	30	9	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.10	Even those who had eaten wanted to eat it, let alone those who were hungry.	mn5	30	10	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.11	In the same way, when these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant … their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.	mn5	30	11	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.12	Why is that?	mn5	30	12	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:30.13	It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable.”	mn5	30	13	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him,	mn5	31	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.2	“Reverend Sāriputta, a simile strikes me.”	mn5	31	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta.	mn5	31	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.4	“Reverend, this one time I was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold.	mn5	31	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.5	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	mn5	31	5	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.6	Now at that time Samīti of the wainwrights was planing the rim of a chariot wheel.	mn5	31	6	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.7	The Ājīvaka ascetic Paṇḍuputta, who was formerly of the wainwrights, was standing by,	mn5	31	7	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.8	and this thought came to his mind:	mn5	31	8	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.9	‘Oh, I hope Samīti the wainwright planes out the crooks, bends, and flaws in this rim. Then the rim will be rid of crooks, bends, and flaws, pure, and consolidated in the core.’	mn5	31	9	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.10	And Samīti planed out the flaws in the rim just as Paṇḍuputta thought.	mn5	31	10	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.11	Then Paṇḍuputta expressed his gladness:	mn5	31	11	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:31.12	‘He planes like he knows my heart with his heart!’	mn5	31	12	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:32.1	In the same way, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and idiotic. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart!	mn5	32	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:32.2	But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise and clever. Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say:	mn5	32	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:32.3	‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’	mn5	32	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:33.1	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. Presented with a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head.	mn5	33	1	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:33.2	In the same way, those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith … say:	mn5	33	2	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:33.3	‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’”	mn5	33	3	mn	5	Unblemished
mn5:33.4	And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.	mn5	33	4	mn	5	Unblemished
mn6:1.1	So I have heard.	mn6	1	1	mn	6	One Might Wish
mn6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn6	1	2	mn	6	One Might Wish

May I remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view.

mn7:2.2	No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look poorly dyed and impure in color.	mn7	2	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:2.3	Why is that?	mn7	2	3	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:2.4	Because of the impurity of the cloth.	mn7	2	4	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:2.5	In the same way, when the mind is corrupt, a bad destiny is to be expected.	mn7	2	5	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth

mn7:2.8	Why is that?	mn7	2	8	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:2.9	Because of the purity of the cloth.	mn7	2	9	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:2.10	In the same way, when the mind isn’t corrupt, a good destiny is to be expected.	mn7	2	10	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:3.1	And what are the corruptions of the mind?	mn7	3	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:3.2	Covetousness and immoral greed, ill will, anger, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, aggression, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence are corruptions of the mind.	mn7	3	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:4.1	A mendicant who understands that covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind gives them up.	mn7	4	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:4.2	A mendicant who understands that ill will …	mn7	4	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:4.30	negligence is a corruption of the mind gives it up.	mn7	4	30	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:5.1	When they have understood these corruptions of the mind	mn7	5	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:5.2	for what they are, and have given them up,	mn7	5	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:5.32	they have experiential confidence in the Buddha:	mn7	5	32	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:5.33	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn7	5	33	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:6.1	They have experiential confidence in the teaching:	mn7	6	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:6.2	‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’	mn7	6	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:7.1	They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:	mn7	7	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:7.2	‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’	mn7	7	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:8.1	When a mendicant has discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent, thinking, ‘I have experiential confidence in the Buddha …	mn7	8	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:9.1	the teaching …	mn7	9	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth

mn7:11.1	Thinking: ‘I have discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.	mn7	11	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:11.2	When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn7	11	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:12.1	When a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them.	mn7	12	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:12.2	Compare with cloth that is dirty and soiled; it can be made pure and clean by pure water. Or native gold, which can be made pure and bright by a forge.	mn7	12	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth

mn7:13.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

mn7:17.1	They understand: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception.’	mn7	17	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:18.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn7	18	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:18.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn7	18	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth

mn7:19.1	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā was sitting not far from the Buddha.	mn7	19	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:19.2	He said to the Buddha,	mn7	19	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:19.3	“But does the worthy Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to bathe?”	mn7	19	3	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:19.4	“Brahmin, why go to the river Bāhuka?	mn7	19	4	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:19.5	What can the river Bāhuka do?”	mn7	19	5	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:19.6	“Many people deem that the river Bāhukā leads to a heavenly world and bestows merit. And many people wash off their bad deeds in the river Bāhukā.”	mn7	19	6	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.1	Then the Buddha addressed Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā in verse:	mn7	20	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.2	“The Bāhukā and the Adhikakkā,	mn7	20	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.3	at Gayā and the Sundarikā too,	mn7	20	3	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.4	Sarasvatī and Payāga,	mn7	20	4	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.5	and the river Bāhumatī:	mn7	20	5	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.6	a fool can constantly plunge into them	mn7	20	6	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.7	but it won’t purify their dark deeds.	mn7	20	7	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.8	What can the Sundarikā do?	mn7	20	8	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.9	What the Payāga or the Bāhukā?	mn7	20	9	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.10	They can’t cleanse a cruel person, a sinner	mn7	20	10	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.11	from their bad deeds.	mn7	20	11	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.12	For the pure in heart it’s always	mn7	20	12	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.13	the spring festival or the sabbath.	mn7	20	13	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.14	For the pure in heart and clean of deed,	mn7	20	14	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.15	their vows will always be fulfilled.	mn7	20	15	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.16	It’s here alone that you should bathe, brahmin,	mn7	20	16	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.17	making yourself a sanctuary for all creatures.	mn7	20	17	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.18	And if you speak no lies,	mn7	20	18	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.19	nor harm any living creature,	mn7	20	19	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.20	nor steal anything not given,	mn7	20	20	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.21	and you’re faithful and not stingy:	mn7	20	21	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.22	what’s the point of going to Gayā?	mn7	20	22	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:20.23	For any well may be your Gayā!”	mn7	20	23	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:21.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā said to the Buddha,	mn7	21	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:21.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn7	21	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:21.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn7	21	3	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:21.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn7	21	4	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:21.5	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	mn7	21	5	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:22.1	And the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn7	22	1	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:22.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn7	22	2	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:22.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn7	22	3	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn7:22.4	And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.	mn7	22	4	mn	7	The Simile of the Cloth
mn8:1.1	So I have heard.	mn8	1	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn8	1	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	mn8	2	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.1	“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world	mn8	3	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.2	connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.	mn8	3	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.3	How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views?”	mn8	3	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.4	“Cunda, there are many different views that arise in the world	mn8	3	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.5	connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.	mn8	3	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:3.6	A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise, where they settle in, and where they operate as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn8	3	6	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:4.1	It’s possible that a certain mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, might enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn8	4	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:4.2	They might think	mn8	4	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:4.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	4	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:4.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	4	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:4.5	they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.	mn8	4	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:5.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, might enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn8	5	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:5.2	They might think	mn8	5	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:5.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	5	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:5.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	5	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:5.5	they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.	mn8	5	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:6.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, might enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn8	6	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:6.2	They might think	mn8	6	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:6.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	6	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:6.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	6	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:6.5	they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.	mn8	6	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:7.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, might enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn8	7	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:7.2	They might think	mn8	7	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:7.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	7	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:7.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	7	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:7.5	they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.	mn8	7	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:8.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.	mn8	8	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:8.2	They might think	mn8	8	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:8.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	8	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:8.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	8	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:8.5	they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.	mn8	8	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:9.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	mn8	9	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:9.2	They might think	mn8	9	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:9.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	9	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:9.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	9	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:9.5	they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.	mn8	9	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:10.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, might enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.	mn8	10	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:10.2	They might think	mn8	10	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:10.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	10	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:10.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	10	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:10.5	they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.	mn8	10	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:11.1	It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, might enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn8	11	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:11.2	They might think	mn8	11	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:11.3	they’re practicing self-effacement.	mn8	11	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:11.4	But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’;	mn8	11	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:11.5	they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’.	mn8	11	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.1	Now, Cunda, you should work on self-effacement in each of the following ways.	mn8	12	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.2	‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’	mn8	12	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.3	‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’	mn8	12	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.4	‘Others will steal, but here we will not steal.’	mn8	12	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.5	‘Others will be unchaste, but here we will not be unchaste.’	mn8	12	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.6	‘Others will lie, but here we will not lie.’	mn8	12	6	mn	8	Self-Effacement

mn8:12.8	‘Others will speak harshly, but here we will not speak harshly.’	mn8	12	8	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.9	‘Others will talk nonsense, but here we will not talk nonsense.’	mn8	12	9	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.10	‘Others will be covetous, but here we will not be covetous.’	mn8	12	10	mn	8	Self-Effacement

mn8:12.13	‘Others will have wrong thought, but here we will have right thought.’	mn8	12	13	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.14	‘Others will have wrong speech, but here we will have right speech.’	mn8	12	14	mn	8	Self-Effacement

mn8:12.16	‘Others will have wrong livelihood, but here we will have right livelihood.’	mn8	12	16	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.17	‘Others will have wrong effort, but here we will have right effort.’	mn8	12	17	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.18	‘Others will have wrong mindfulness, but here we will have right mindfulness.’	mn8	12	18	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.19	‘Others will have wrong immersion, but here we will have right immersion.’	mn8	12	19	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.20	‘Others will have wrong knowledge, but here we will have right knowledge.’	mn8	12	20	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.21	‘Others will have wrong freedom, but here we will have right freedom.’	mn8	12	21	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.22	‘Others will be overcome with dullness and drowsiness, but here we will be rid of dullness and drowsiness.’	mn8	12	22	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.23	‘Others will be restless, but here we will not be restless.’	mn8	12	23	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.24	‘Others will have doubts, but here we will have gone beyond doubt.’	mn8	12	24	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.25	‘Others will be irritable, but here we will be without anger.’	mn8	12	25	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.26	‘Others will be acrimonious, but here we will be without acrimony.’	mn8	12	26	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.27	‘Others will be offensive, but here we will be inoffensive.’	mn8	12	27	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.28	‘Others will be contemptuous, but here we will be without contempt.’	mn8	12	28	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.29	‘Others will be jealous, but here we will be without jealousy.’	mn8	12	29	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.30	‘Others will be stingy, but here we will be without stinginess.’	mn8	12	30	mn	8	Self-Effacement

mn8:12.34	‘Others will be arrogant, but here we will not be arrogant.’	mn8	12	34	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.35	‘Others will be hard to admonish, but here we will not be hard to admonish.’	mn8	12	35	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.36	‘Others will have bad friends, but here we will have good friends.’	mn8	12	36	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.37	‘Others will be negligent, but here we will be diligent.’	mn8	12	37	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.38	‘Others will be faithless, but here we will have faith.’	mn8	12	38	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.39	‘Others will be conscienceless, but here we will have a sense of conscience.’	mn8	12	39	mn	8	Self-Effacement

mn8:12.41	‘Others will be unlearned, but here we will be well learned.’	mn8	12	41	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.42	‘Others will be lazy, but here we will be energetic.’	mn8	12	42	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.43	‘Others will be unmindful, but here we will be mindful.’	mn8	12	43	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.44	‘Others will be witless, but here we will be accomplished in wisdom.’	mn8	12	44	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:12.45	‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’	mn8	12	45	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:13.1	Cunda, I say that even giving rise to the thought of skillful qualities is very helpful, let alone following that path in body and speech.	mn8	13	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:13.2	That’s why you should give rise to the following thoughts. ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’	mn8	13	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:13.3	‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’ …	mn8	13	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:13.4	‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’	mn8	13	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:14.1	Cunda, suppose there was a rough path and another smooth path to get around it.	mn8	14	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:14.2	Or suppose there was a rough ford and another smooth ford to get around it.	mn8	14	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:14.3	In the same way, a cruel individual bypasses it by not being cruel. An individual who kills bypasses it by not killing. …	mn8	14	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:14.5	An individual who is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, gets around it by not being attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	mn8	14	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:15.1	Cunda, all unskillful qualities lead downwards, while all skillful qualities lead upwards.	mn8	15	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:15.2	In the same way, a cruel individual is led upwards by not being cruel. An individual who kills is led upwards by not killing …	mn8	15	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:15.3	An individual who is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, is led upwards by not being attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	mn8	15	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.1	If you’re sinking in the mud yourself, Cunda, it is quite impossible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud.	mn8	16	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.2	But if you’re not sinking in the mud yourself, it is quite possible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud.	mn8	16	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.3	If you’re not tamed, trained, and quenched yourself, it is quite impossible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else.	mn8	16	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.4	But if you are tamed, trained, and quenched yourself, it is quite possible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else.	mn8	16	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.5	In the same way, a cruel individual extinguishes it by not being cruel. An individual who kills extinguishes it by not killing. …	mn8	16	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:16.47	An individual who is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, extinguishes it by not being attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	mn8	16	47	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.1	So, Cunda, I’ve taught the expositions by way of self-effacement, arising of thought, bypassing, going up, and extinguishing.	mn8	17	1	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.2	Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.	mn8	17	2	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.3	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Cunda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction.”	mn8	17	3	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn8	17	4	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.5	Satisfied, Venerable Mahācunda approved what the Buddha said.	mn8	17	5	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.6	Forty-four items have been stated,	mn8	17	6	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.7	organized into five sections.	mn8	17	7	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.8	“Effacement” is the name of this discourse,	mn8	17	8	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn8:17.9	which is deep as the ocean.	mn8	17	9	mn	8	Self-Effacement
mn9:1.1	So I have heard.	mn9	1	1	mn	9	Right View
mn9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn9	1	2	mn	9	Right View
mn9:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:	mn9	1	3	mn	9	Right View
mn9:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	mn9	1	4	mn	9	Right View
mn9:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	mn9	1	5	mn	9	Right View
mn9:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	mn9	1	6	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.1	“Reverends, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’.	mn9	2	1	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.2	How do you define a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”	mn9	2	2	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.3	“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.	mn9	2	3	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.4	May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.	mn9	2	4	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.5	The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn9	2	5	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.6	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn9	2	6	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.7	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn9	2	7	mn	9	Right View
mn9:2.8	Sāriputta said this:	mn9	2	8	mn	9	Right View
mn9:3.1	“A noble disciple understands the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root.	mn9	3	1	mn	9	Right View
mn9:3.2	When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.	mn9	3	2	mn	9	Right View

mn11:1.1	So I have heard.	mn11	1	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn11	1	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn11	1	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn11	1	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn11	1	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn11	1	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:2.1	“‘Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic.	mn11	2	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:2.2	Other sects are empty of ascetics.’	mn11	2	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:2.3	This, mendicants, is how you should rightly roar your lion’s roar.	mn11	2	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say:	mn11	3	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.2	‘But what is the source of the venerables’ certainty and forcefulness that they say this?’	mn11	3	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.5	You should say to them:	mn11	3	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.6	‘There are four things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Seeing these things in ourselves we say that:	mn11	3	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.7	“Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic.	mn11	3	7	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.8	Other sects are empty of ascetics.”	mn11	3	8	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.9	What four?	mn11	3	9	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.10	We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in the teaching, and we have fulfilled the precepts.	mn11	3	10	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.11	And we have love and affection for those who share our path,	mn11	3	11	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.12	both laypeople and renunciates.	mn11	3	12	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:3.13	These are the four things.’	mn11	3	13	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:4.1	It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say:	mn11	4	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:4.2	‘We too have confidence in the Teacher—our Teacher; we have confidence in the teaching—our teaching; and we have fulfilled the precepts—our precepts.	mn11	4	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:4.4	both laypeople and renunciates.	mn11	4	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:4.5	What, then, is the difference between you and us?’	mn11	4	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.1	You should say to them:	mn11	5	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.2	‘Well, reverends, is the goal one or many?’	mn11	5	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.3	Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:	mn11	5	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.4	‘The goal is one, reverends, not many.’	mn11	5	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.5	‘But is that goal for the greedy or for those free of greed?’	mn11	5	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.6	Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:	mn11	5	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.7	‘That goal is for those free of greed, not for the greedy.’	mn11	5	7	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.8	‘Is it for the hateful or those free of hate?’	mn11	5	8	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:5.13	‘It’s for those free of delusion.’	mn11	5	13	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.14	‘Is it for those who crave or those rid of craving?’	mn11	5	14	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.16	‘It’s for those rid of craving.’	mn11	5	16	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.17	‘Is it for those who have fuel for grasping or those who do not?’	mn11	5	17	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.19	‘It’s for those who do not have fuel for grasping.’	mn11	5	19	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.20	‘Is it for the knowledgeable or the ignorant?’	mn11	5	20	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:5.25	‘It’s for those who don’t favor and oppose.’	mn11	5	25	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.26	‘But is that goal for those who enjoy proliferation or for those who enjoy non-proliferation?’	mn11	5	26	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.27	Answering rightly, the wanderers would say:	mn11	5	27	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:5.28	‘It’s for those who enjoy non-proliferation, not for those who enjoy proliferation.’	mn11	5	28	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:6.1	Mendicants, there are these two views:	mn11	6	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:6.2	views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence.	mn11	6	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:6.3	Any ascetics or brahmins who resort to, draw near to, and cling to a view favoring continued existence will oppose a view favoring ending existence.	mn11	6	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:6.4	Any ascetics or brahmins who resort to, draw near to, and cling to a view favoring ending existence will oppose a view favoring continued existence.	mn11	6	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:7.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand these two views’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape. They’re greedy, hateful, delusional, craving, grasping, and ignorant. They favor and oppose, and they enjoy proliferation.	mn11	7	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:7.2	They’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn11	7	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:7.3	They’re not freed from suffering, I say.	mn11	7	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:8.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these two views’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.

mn11:8.3	They’re freed from suffering, I say.	mn11	8	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:9.1	There are these four kinds of grasping.	mn11	9	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:9.2	What four?	mn11	9	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:9.3	Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.	mn11	9	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping.	mn11	10	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.2	But they don’t correctly describe the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping.	mn11	10	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.3	They describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures, but not views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.	mn11	10	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.4	Why is that?	mn11	10	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.5	Because those gentlemen don’t truly understand these three things.	mn11	10	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.6	That’s why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,	mn11	10	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:10.7	but they don’t really.	mn11	10	7	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:11.1	There are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,	mn11	11	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:11.2	but they don’t really.	mn11	11	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:11.4	Why is that?	mn11	11	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:11.5	Because those gentlemen don’t truly understand these two things.	mn11	11	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:11.6	That’s why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,	mn11	11	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:12.4	Why is that?	mn11	12	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:12.5	Because those gentlemen don’t truly understand this one thing.	mn11	12	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:12.6	That’s why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping,	mn11	12	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:12.7	but they don’t really.	mn11	12	7	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:13.1	In such a teaching and training, confidence in the Teacher is said to be not rightly placed.	mn11	13	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:13.2	Likewise, confidence in the teaching,	mn11	13	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:13.4	and love and affection for those sharing the same path are said to be not rightly placed.	mn11	13	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:13.5	Why is that?	mn11	13	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:13.6	It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.	mn11	13	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:14.1	The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha claims to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping.	mn11	14	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:14.2	He describes the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.	mn11	14	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:15.5	Why is that?	mn11	15	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:16.1	What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of these four kinds of grasping?	mn11	16	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:16.4	Feeling.	mn11	16	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:16.6	Contact.	mn11	16	6	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn11:16.14	Choices.	mn11	16	14	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:16.15	And what is the source of choices?	mn11	16	15	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:16.16	Ignorance.	mn11	16	16	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:17.1	When that mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t grasp at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, or theories of a self.	mn11	17	1	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:17.2	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	mn11	17	2	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:17.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	mn11	17	3	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:17.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn11	17	4	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn11:17.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn11	17	5	mn	11	The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:1.1	So I have heard.	mn12	1	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying outside the city of Vesālī in a woodland grove west of the town.	mn12	1	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:2.1	Now at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and training.	mn12	2	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:2.2	He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:	mn12	2	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:2.3	“The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn12	2	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:2.4	He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.	mn12	2	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:2.5	And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.”	mn12	2	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:3.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	mn12	3	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:3.2	He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying.	mn12	3	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:3.6	Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	mn12	3	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:4.1	“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that futile man, is angry.	mn12	4	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn12:4.3	Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, in fact he just praises him.	mn12	4	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn12:6.1	And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:	mn12	6	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:6.2	‘That Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’	mn12	6	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:7.1	And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:	mn12	7	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

mn12:9.1	There are these ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.	mn12	9	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar

They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view.

When all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion had faded away, they emerged and sat or lay down in that woodland thicket, where they experienced feelings of perfect happiness.	mn12	42	9	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:42.10	In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:	mn12	42	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:42.11	‘This person is practicing in such a way and is riding upon such a path that they will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’	mn12	42	11	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:42.12	Some time later I see that they have indeed realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, experiencing feelings of perfect happiness.	mn12	42	12	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:42.13	These are the five destinations.	mn12	42	13	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.1	When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this:	mn12	43	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.2	‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn12	43	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.3	He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.’	mn12	43	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.4	Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.	mn12	43	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.5	Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say.	mn12	43	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:43.6	Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.	mn12	43	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:44.1	Sāriputta, I recall having practiced a spiritual path consisting of four factors.	mn12	44	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:44.2	I used to be a fervent mortifier, the ultimate fervent mortifier. I used to live rough, the ultimate rough-liver. I used to live in disgust of sin, the ultimate one living in disgust of sin. I used to be secluded, in ultimate seclusion.	mn12	44	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.1	And this is what my fervent mortification was like. I went naked, ignoring conventions. I licked my hands, and didn’t come or stop when asked. I didn’t consent to food brought to me, or food prepared specially for me, or an invitation for a meal.	mn12	45	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.2	I didn’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where food for distribution is advertised; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. I accepted no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drank no fermented gruel.	mn12	45	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.3	I went to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	mn12	45	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.4	I fed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	mn12	45	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.5	I ate once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	mn12	45	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.6	I ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	mn12	45	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.7	I wore robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	mn12	45	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.8	I tore out hair and beard, committed to this practice.	mn12	45	8	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.9	I constantly stood, refusing seats.	mn12	45	9	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.10	I squatted, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	mn12	45	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.11	I lay on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns my bed.	mn12	45	11	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.12	I was devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	mn12	45	12	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.13	And so I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	mn12	45	13	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:45.14	Such was my practice of fervent mortification.	mn12	45	14	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.1	And this is what my rough living was like.	mn12	46	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.2	The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off.	mn12	46	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.3	It’s like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off.	mn12	46	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.4	But it didn’t occur to me:	mn12	46	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.5	‘Oh, this dust and dirt must be rubbed off by my hand or another’s.’	mn12	46	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.6	That didn’t occur to me.	mn12	46	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:46.7	Such was my rough living.	mn12	46	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:47.1	And this is what my living in disgust of sin was like.	mn12	47	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:47.2	I’d step forward or back ever so mindfully, so I was full of pity regarding even a drop of water, thinking:	mn12	47	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:47.3	‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’	mn12	47	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:47.4	Such was my living in disgust of sin.	mn12	47	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.1	And this is what my seclusion was like.	mn12	48	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.2	I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there.	mn12	48	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.3	When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I’d flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands.	mn12	48	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.4	Why is that?	mn12	48	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.5	So that I wouldn’t see them, nor they me.	mn12	48	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.6	I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being.	mn12	48	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:48.10	Such was my practice of seclusion.	mn12	48	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:49.1	I would go on all fours into the cow-pens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calves.	mn12	49	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:49.2	As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that.	mn12	49	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:49.3	Such was my eating of most unnatural things.	mn12	49	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.1	I would plunge deep into an awe-inspiring forest grove and stay there.	mn12	50	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.2	It was so awe-inspiring that	mn12	50	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.3	normally it would make your hair stand on end if you weren’t free of greed.	mn12	50	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.4	And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the January winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day.	mn12	50	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.5	But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night.	mn12	50	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.6	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	mn12	50	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.7	‘Scorched and frozen,	mn12	50	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.8	alone in the awe-inspiring forest.	mn12	50	8	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.9	Naked, no fire to sit beside,	mn12	50	9	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:50.10	the sage still pursues his quest.’	mn12	50	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:51.1	I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow.	mn12	51	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:51.2	Then village louts would come up to me. They’d spit and piss on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears.	mn12	51	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:51.3	But I don’t recall ever having a bad thought about them.	mn12	51	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:51.4	Such was my abiding in equanimity.	mn12	51	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	52	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.2	‘Purity comes from food.’	mn12	52	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.3	They say:	mn12	52	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.4	‘Let’s live on jujubes.’	mn12	52	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.5	So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice.	mn12	52	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.6	And they enjoy many jujube concoctions.	mn12	52	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.7	I recall eating just a single jujube.	mn12	52	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.8	You might think that	mn12	52	8	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.9	at that time the jujubes must have been very big.	mn12	52	9	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.10	But you should not see it like this.	mn12	52	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.11	The jujubes then were at most the same size as today.	mn12	52	11	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.12	Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated.	mn12	52	12	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.13	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	mn12	52	13	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.14	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	mn12	52	14	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.15	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	mn12	52	15	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.16	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	mn12	52	16	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.17	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	mn12	52	17	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.18	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	mn12	52	18	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.19	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	mn12	52	19	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.20	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	mn12	52	20	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:52.21	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	mn12	52	21	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	53-55	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.2	‘Purity comes from food.’	mn12	53-55	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.3	They say:	mn12	53-55	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.4	‘Let’s live on mung beans.’ …	mn12	53-55	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.5	‘Let’s live on sesame.’ …	mn12	53-55	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.6	‘Let’s live on ordinary rice.’ …	mn12	53-55	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:53-55.23	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	mn12	53-55	23	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:56.1	But Sāriputta, I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work.	mn12	56	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:56.2	Why is that?	mn12	56	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:56.3	Because I didn’t achieve that noble wisdom that’s noble and emancipating, and which delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.	mn12	56	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:57.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	57	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:57.2	‘Purity comes from transmigration.’	mn12	57	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:57.3	But it’s not easy to find a realm that I haven’t previously transmigrated to in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.	mn12	57	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:57.4	For if I had transmigrated to the gods of the pure abodes I would not have returned to this realm again.	mn12	57	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:58.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	58	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:58.2	‘Purity comes from rebirth.’	mn12	58	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:58.3	But it’s not easy to find any rebirth that I haven’t previously been reborn in …	mn12	58	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:59.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	59	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:59.2	‘Purity comes from abode of rebirth.’	mn12	59	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:59.3	But it’s not easy to find an abode where I haven’t previously abided …	mn12	59	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:60.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	60	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:60.2	‘Purity comes from sacrifice.’	mn12	60	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:60.3	But it’s not easy to find a sacrifice that I haven’t previously offered in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	mn12	60	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:61.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	61	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:61.2	‘Purity comes from serving the sacred flame.’	mn12	61	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:61.3	But it’s not easy to find a fire that I haven’t previously served in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	mn12	61	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn12	62	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.2	‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of wisdom.	mn12	62	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.3	But when he’s old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his lucidity of wisdom.’	mn12	62	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.4	But you should not see it like this.	mn12	62	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.5	For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.	mn12	62	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.6	Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.	mn12	62	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.7	Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree.	mn12	62	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.8	That’s how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.	mn12	62	8	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.9	They’d bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again, and I would answer each question. They’d remember the answers and not ask the same question twice.	mn12	62	9	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.10	And they’d pause only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, or spontaneous answers.	mn12	62	10	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.11	And at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass away.	mn12	62	11	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:62.12	Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s lucidity of wisdom.	mn12	62	12	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:63.1	And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that	mn12	63	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:63.2	a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.”	mn12	63	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.1	Now at that time Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.	mn12	64	1	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.2	Then he said to the Buddha:	mn12	64	2	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.3	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn12	64	3	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.4	While I was listening to this exposition of the teaching my hair stood up!	mn12	64	4	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.5	What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”	mn12	64	5	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.6	“Well then, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Hair-raising Discourse’.”	mn12	64	6	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.7	That is what the Buddha said.	mn12	64	7	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn12:64.8	Satisfied, Venerable Nāgasamāla approved what the Buddha said.	mn12	64	8	mn	12	The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
mn13:1.1	So I have heard.	mn13	1	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn13	1	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn13	2	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.2	Then it occurred to them,	mn13	2	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.	mn13	2	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.4	Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?”	mn13	2	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.5	Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.	mn13	2	5	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:2.6	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them:	mn13	2	6	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:3.1	“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, and so do we.	mn13	3	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:3.2	The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of forms, and so do we.	mn13	3	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:3.3	The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we.	mn13	3	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:3.4	What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”	mn13	3	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:4.1	Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions.	mn13	4	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:4.2	They got up from their seat, thinking,	mn13	4	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:4.3	“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”	mn13	4	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:5.1	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:	mn13	5	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:6.1	“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them:	mn13	6	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:6.4	What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to feelings?’	mn13	6	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:6.5	Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated.	mn13	6	5	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:6.6	Why is that?	mn13	6	6	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:6.7	Because they’re out of their element.	mn13	6	7	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:6.8	I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.	mn13	6	8	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:7.1	And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures?	mn13	7	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:7.2	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn13	7	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:7.4	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn13	7	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:8.1	And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures?	mn13	8	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:8.2	It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as	mn13	8	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:8.5	This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.	mn13	8	5	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:9.1	That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money.	mn13	9	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:9.2	If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying:	mn13	9	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:10.3	‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’	mn13	10	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:10.4	And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it.	mn13	10	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.	mn13	11	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:11.2	Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords,	mn13	11	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:32.1	And what is the gratification of feelings?	mn13	32	1	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:32.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn13	32	2	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:32.3	At that time a mendicant doesn’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt both;	mn13	32	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn13:38.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn13	38	3	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn13:38.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn13	38	4	mn	13	The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:1.1	So I have heard.	mn14	1	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	mn14	1	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:2.1	Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn14	2	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:2.2	“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:	mn14	2	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:3.1	“Mahānāma, there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughts.	mn14	3	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:3.2	For if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.	mn14	3	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:3.3	But because you haven’t given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.	mn14	3	3	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:4.1	Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn14	4	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:4.2	So, Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom, as long as they do not achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,	mn14	4	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:4.3	they can return to sensual pleasures.	mn14	4	3	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:4.4	But when they do achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,	mn14	4	4	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:5.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right wisdom that:	mn14	5	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:5.2	‘Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’	mn14	5	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:5.3	But so long as I didn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,	mn14	5	3	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:5.4	I didn’t announce that I would not return to sensual pleasures.	mn14	5	4	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:6.1	And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures?	mn14	6	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:6.2	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn14	6	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:15.1	Mahānāma, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	mn14	15	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:15.2	Now at that time several Jain ascetics on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they felt painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion.	mn14	15	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:16.1	Then in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jain ascetics. I said to them,	mn14	16	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:16.2	‘Reverends, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’	mn14	16	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.1	When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me,	mn14	17	1	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.2	‘Reverend, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	mn14	17	2	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:17.4	He says,	mn14	17	4	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.5	“O Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.	mn14	17	5	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.6	And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future.	mn14	17	6	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.7	So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.	mn14	17	7	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn14:17.8	With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”	mn14	17	8	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering

mn14:21.23	Satisfied, Mahānāma the Sakyan approved what the Buddha said.	mn14	21	23	mn	14	The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
mn15:1.1	So I have heard.	mn15	1	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	mn15	1	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:1.3	There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:	mn15	1	3	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	mn15	1	4	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	mn15	1	5	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:1.6	Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:	mn15	1	6	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:2.1	“Suppose a mendicant invites	mn15	2	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:2.2	other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions don’t think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person doesn’t gain their trust.	mn15	2	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.1	And what are the qualities that make them hard to admonish?	mn15	3	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.2	Firstly, a mendicant has corrupt wishes, having fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.	mn15	3	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.4	This is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.	mn15	3	4	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.5	Furthermore, a mendicant glorifies themselves and puts others down. …	mn15	3	5	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.8	They’re irritable, overcome by anger …	mn15	3	8	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.11	They’re irritable, and acrimonious due to anger …	mn15	3	11	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.14	They’re irritable, and stubborn due to anger …	mn15	3	14	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.17	They’re irritable, and blurt out words bordering on anger …	mn15	3	17	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.20	When accused, they object to the accuser …	mn15	3	20	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.23	When accused, they rebuke the accuser …	mn15	3	23	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.26	When accused, they retort to the accuser …	mn15	3	26	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.29	When accused, they dodge the issue, distract the discussion with irrelevant points, and display annoyance, hate, and bitterness …	mn15	3	29	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.32	When accused, they are unable to account for the evidence …	mn15	3	32	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.35	They are offensive and contemptuous …	mn15	3	35	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.38	They’re jealous and stingy …	mn15	3	38	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.41	They’re devious and deceitful …	mn15	3	41	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.44	They’re obstinate and arrogant …	mn15	3	44	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.47	Furthermore, a mendicant is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.	mn15	3	47	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.49	This too is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.	mn15	3	49	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:3.50	These are the qualities that make them hard to admonish.	mn15	3	50	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:4.1	Suppose a mendicant doesn’t invite	mn15	4	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:4.2	other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re accepting, and take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person gains their trust.	mn15	4	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:5.1	And what are the qualities that make them easy to admonish?	mn15	5	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:5.2	Firstly, a mendicant doesn’t have corrupt wishes …	mn15	5	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:5.47	Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.	mn15	5	47	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:5.50	These are the qualities that make them easy to admonish.	mn15	5	50	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.1	In such a case, a mendicant should measure themselves like this.	mn15	6	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.2	‘This person has corrupt wishes, having fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. And I don’t like or approve of this person.	mn15	6	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.3	And if I were to fall under the sway of corrupt wishes, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’	mn15	6	3	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.4	A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not fall under the sway of corrupt wishes.’ …	mn15	6	4	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.47	‘This person is attached to their own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go. And I don’t like or approve of this person.	mn15	6	47	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.48	And if I were to be attached to my own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’	mn15	6	48	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:6.49	A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not be attached to my own views, holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’	mn15	6	49	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.1	In such a case, a mendicant should check themselves like this:	mn15	7	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.2	‘Do I have corrupt wishes? Have I fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes?’	mn15	7	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.3	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	mn15	7	3	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.4	they have fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.	mn15	7	4	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.5	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	mn15	7	5	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.6	they haven’t fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities. …	mn15	7	6	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.89	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	mn15	7	89	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.90	they are attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.	mn15	7	90	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.91	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	mn15	7	91	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:7.92	they’re not attached to their own views, holding them tight, but let them go easily. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.	mn15	7	92	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.1	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should make an effort to give them all up.	mn15	8	1	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.2	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.	mn15	8	2	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.3	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they’d try to remove it.	mn15	8	3	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.4	But if they don’t see any dirt or blemish there, they’re happy, thinking:	mn15	8	4	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.5	‘How fortunate that I’m clean!’	mn15	8	5	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.6	In the same way, suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should make an effort to give them all up.	mn15	8	6	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.7	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.”	mn15	8	7	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.8	This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said.	mn15	8	8	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn15:8.9	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said.	mn15	8	9	mn	15	Measuring Up
mn16:1.1	So I have heard.	mn16	1	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn16	1	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness

mn16:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn16	1	5	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn16	1	6	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:2.1	“Mendicants, when a mendicant has not given up five kinds of hard-heartedness and severed five shackles of the heart, it’s not possible for them to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.	mn16	2	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:3.1	What are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up?	mn16	3	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:3.2	Firstly, a mendicant has doubts about the Teacher. They’re uncertain, undecided, and lacking confidence.	mn16	3	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:3.3	This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.	mn16	3	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:3.4	This is the first kind of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up.	mn16	3	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:4.1	Furthermore, a mendicant has doubts about the teaching …	mn16	4	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:4.2	This is the second kind of hard-heartedness.	mn16	4	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:5.1	They have doubts about the Saṅgha …	mn16	5	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:5.2	This is the third kind of hard-heartedness.	mn16	5	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:6.1	They have doubts about the training …	mn16	6	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:6.3	This is the fourth kind of hard-heartedness.	mn16	6	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is angry and upset with their spiritual companions, resentful and closed off.	mn16	7	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:7.2	This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.	mn16	7	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness

mn16:7.4	These are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up.	mn16	7	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:8.1	What are the five shackles of the heart they haven’t severed?	mn16	8	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:8.2	Firstly, a mendicant isn’t free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures.	mn16	8	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:8.3	This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.	mn16	8	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:8.4	This is the first shackle of the heart they haven’t severed.	mn16	8	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for the body …	mn16	9	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:9.2	This is the second shackle of the heart.	mn16	9	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:10.1	Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for form …	mn16	10	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:10.2	This is the third shackle of the heart.	mn16	10	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:11.1	They eat as much as they like until their belly is full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing …	mn16	11	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:11.3	This is the fourth heart shackle.	mn16	11	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:12.1	They lead the spiritual life hoping to be reborn in one of the orders of gods, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’	mn16	12	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:12.2	This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.	mn16	12	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:12.3	This is the fifth shackle of the heart they haven’t severed.	mn16	12	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness

mn16:20.1	What are the five shackles of the heart they’ve severed?	mn16	20	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:20.2	Firstly, a mendicant is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures.	mn16	20	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:20.3	This being so, their mind inclines toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving.	mn16	20	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:20.4	This is the first shackle of the heart they’ve severed.	mn16	20	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness

mn16:24.4	These are the five shackles of the heart they’ve severed.	mn16	24	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:25.1	When a mendicant has given up these five kinds of hard-heartedness and severed these five shackles of the heart, it is possible for them to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.	mn16	25	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:26.1	They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort …	mn16	26	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:26.2	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort …	mn16	26	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:26.3	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort …	mn16	26	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:26.4	the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. And the fifth is sheer vigor.	mn16	26	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.1	A mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors, including vigor, is capable of breaking out, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn16	27	1	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.2	Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.	mn16	27	2	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.3	And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.	mn16	27	3	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.4	Even if that chicken doesn’t wish:	mn16	27	4	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.5	‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’	mn16	27	5	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.6	Still they can break out and hatch safely.	mn16	27	6	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.7	In the same way, a mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors, including vigor, is capable of breaking out, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.”	mn16	27	7	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.8	That is what the Buddha said.	mn16	27	8	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn16:27.9	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn16	27	9	mn	16	Hard-heartedness
mn17:1.1	So I have heard.	mn17	1	1	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn17	1	2	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn17	1	3	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn17	1	4	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn17	1	5	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn17	1	6	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets.	mn17	2	1	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn17	2	2	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn17	2	3	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:2.4	The Buddha said this:	mn17	2	4	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:3.1	“Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.	mn17	3	1	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:3.2	As they do so, their mindfulness does not become established, their mind does not become immersed in samādhi, their defilements do not come to an end, and they do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn17	3	2	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:3.3	And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.	mn17	3	3	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:3.4	That mendicant should reflect:	mn17	3	4	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:3.5	‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my mindfulness does not become established, my mind does not become immersed in samādhi, my defilements do not come to an end, and I do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn17	3	5	mn	17	Jungle Thickets

mn17:3.7	That mendicant should leave that jungle thicket that very time of night or day; they should not stay there.	mn17	3	7	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:4.1	Take another case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.	mn17	4	1	mn	17	Jungle Thickets

mn17:5.3	But the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by. That mendicant should reflect:	mn17	5	3	mn	17	Jungle Thickets

mn17:26.8	That is what the Buddha said.	mn17	26	8	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn17:26.9	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn17	26	9	mn	17	Jungle Thickets
mn18:1.1	So I have heard.	mn18	1	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	mn18	1	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.	mn18	2	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood for the day’s meditation,	mn18	2	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:2.3	plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood-apple tree to meditate.	mn18	2	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:3.1	Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk,	mn18	3	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:3.2	plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn18	3	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:3.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha,	mn18	3	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:3.4	“What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?”	mn18	3	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:4.1	“Good sir, my doctrine is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state.	mn18	4	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:4.2	That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.”	mn18	4	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:5.1	When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and departed leaning on his staff.	mn18	5	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:6.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out,	mn18	6	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:6.2	and told the mendicants what had happened.	mn18	6	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:6.14	When he had spoken, one of the mendicants said to him,	mn18	6	14	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:7.1	“But sir, asserting what doctrine does the Buddha not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans?	mn18	7	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:7.2	And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?”	mn18	7	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:8.1	“Mendicant, judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.	mn18	8	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:8.2	If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,	mn18	8	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:8.3	just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies.	mn18	8	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:8.4	This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.”	mn18	8	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:9.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn18	9	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:9.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	mn18	9	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,	mn18	10	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.2	“The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.	mn18	10	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.7	Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?”	mn18	10	7	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.8	Then those mendicants thought,	mn18	10	8	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.9	“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	mn18	10	9	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.10	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn18	10	10	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:10.11	Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”	mn18	10	11	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:11.1	Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn18	11	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:11.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said:	mn18	11	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:11.18	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”	mn18	11	18	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:12.1	“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.	mn18	12	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:12.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.	mn18	12	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:12.3	For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	mn18	12	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:12.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.	mn18	12	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:12.5	You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	mn18	12	5	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	mn18	13	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.2	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.	mn18	13	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.3	We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.	mn18	13	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.4	Still, Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	mn18	13	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.5	You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn18	13	5	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:13.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”	mn18	13	6	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:14.1	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn18	14	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:14.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn18	14	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:14.3	Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:	mn18	14	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:15.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	mn18	15	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:15.2	‘Judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.	mn18	15	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:15.3	If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,	mn18	15	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:15.4	just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies. This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.’ This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.	mn18	15	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:16.1	Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate is the source from which judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present.	mn18	16	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake

mn18:19.1	This is how I understand the detailed meaning of that brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn18	19	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:19.4	If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.	mn18	19	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:19.5	You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	mn18	19	5	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:20.1	Then those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said, rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:	mn18	20	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:20.17	“Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”	mn18	20	17	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:21.1	“Mahākaccāna is astute, mendicants, he has great wisdom.	mn18	21	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:21.2	If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.	mn18	21	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:21.3	That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”	mn18	21	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	mn18	22	1	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.2	“Sir, suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake. Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor.	mn18	22	2	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.3	In the same way, wherever a sincere, capable mendicant might examine with wisdom the meaning of this exposition of the teaching they would only gain joy and clarity.	mn18	22	3	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.4	Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”	mn18	22	4	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.5	“Well then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Honey-Cake Discourse’.”	mn18	22	5	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn18	22	6	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn18:22.7	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn18	22	7	mn	18	The Honey-Cake
mn19:1.1	So I have heard.	mn19	1	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn19	1	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn19	1	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn19	1	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn19	1	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn19	1	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.1	“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:	mn19	2	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.2	‘Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?’	mn19	2	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.3	So I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts	mn19	2	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.4	to one class.	mn19	2	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.5	And I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness	mn19	2	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:2.6	to the second class.	mn19	2	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a sensual thought arose.	mn19	3	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.2	I understood:	mn19	3	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.3	‘This sensual thought has arisen in me.	mn19	3	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.4	It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’	mn19	3	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.5	When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself, it went away.	mn19	3	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.6	When I reflected that it leads to hurting others, it went away.	mn19	3	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.7	When I reflected that it leads to hurting both, it went away.	mn19	3	7	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.8	When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.	mn19	3	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:3.9	So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any sensual thoughts that arose.	mn19	3	9	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a malicious thought arose …	mn19	4-5	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.2	a cruel thought arose.	mn19	4-5	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.3	I understood:	mn19	4-5	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.4	‘This cruel thought has arisen in me.	mn19	4-5	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.5	It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’	mn19	4-5	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.6	When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself …	mn19	4-5	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.7	hurting others …	mn19	4-5	7	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.8	hurting both, it went away.	mn19	4-5	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.9	When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of distress, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.	mn19	4-5	9	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:4-5.10	So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any cruel thoughts that arose.	mn19	4-5	10	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:6.1	Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.	mn19	6	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:6.2	If they often think about and consider sensual thoughts, they’ve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought. Their mind inclines to sensual thoughts.	mn19	6	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:6.3	If they often think about and consider malicious thoughts … their mind inclines to malicious thoughts.	mn19	6	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:6.4	If they often think about and consider cruel thoughts … their mind inclines to cruel thoughts.	mn19	6	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:7.1	Suppose it’s the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, when the crops grow closely together, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle.	mn19	7	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:7.2	He’d tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in check.	mn19	7	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:7.3	Why is that?	mn19	7	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:7.4	For he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned.	mn19	7	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:7.5	In the same way, I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption, and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.	mn19	7	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of renunciation arose.	mn19	8	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.2	I understood:	mn19	8	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.3	‘This thought of renunciation has arisen in me.	mn19	8	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.4	It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from distress, and it leads to extinguishment.’	mn19	8	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.5	If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …	mn19	8	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.6	all day …	mn19	8	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.7	all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.	mn19	8	7	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.8	Still, thinking and considering for too long would tire my body.	mn19	8	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.9	And when the body is tired, the mind is stressed.	mn19	8	9	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.10	And when the mind is stressed, it’s far from immersion.	mn19	8	10	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.11	So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.	mn19	8	11	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.12	Why is that?	mn19	8	12	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:8.13	So that my mind would not be stressed.	mn19	8	13	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.1	Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of good will arose …	mn19	9-10	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.2	a thought of harmlessness arose.	mn19	9-10	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.3	I understood:	mn19	9-10	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.4	‘This thought of harmlessness has arisen in me.	mn19	9-10	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.5	It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from distress, and it leads to extinguishment.’	mn19	9-10	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.6	If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …	mn19	9-10	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought

mn19:9-10.8	all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.	mn19	9-10	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought

mn19:9-10.12	So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.	mn19	9-10	12	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.13	Why is that?	mn19	9-10	13	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:9-10.14	So that my mind would not be stressed.	mn19	9-10	14	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:11.1	Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.	mn19	11	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:11.2	If they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation, they’ve given up sensual thought to cultivate the thought of renunciation. Their mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation.	mn19	11	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:11.3	If they often think about and consider thoughts of good will … their mind inclines to thoughts of good will.	mn19	11	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:11.4	If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness … their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.	mn19	11	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:12.1	Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered within a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful that	mn19	12	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:12.2	the cattle are there.	mn19	12	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:12.3	In the same way I needed only to be mindful that	mn19	12	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:12.4	those things were there.	mn19	12	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:13.1	My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi and unified.	mn19	13	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:14.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn19	14	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:15.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn19	15	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:16.1	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn19	16	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:17.1	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn19	17	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:18.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	mn19	18	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:18.2	I recollected many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn19	18	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:19.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	mn19	19	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:19.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn19	19	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:20.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this, I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn19	20	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:20.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn19	20	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:21.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	mn19	21	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:21.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn19	21	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:22.1	When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this, I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn19	22	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:22.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	mn19	22	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:23.1	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’	mn19	23	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:23.2	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn19	23	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:23.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	mn19	23	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:24.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	mn19	24	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:24.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn19	24	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.1	Suppose that in a forested wilderness there was an expanse of low-lying marshes,	mn19	25	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.2	and a large herd of deer lived nearby.	mn19	25	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.3	Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them.	mn19	25	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.4	They close off the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and open the wrong path. There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoys	mn19	25	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.5	so that, in due course, that herd of deer would fall to ruin and disaster.	mn19	25	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.6	Then along comes a person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe.	mn19	25	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.7	They open up the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and close off the wrong path. They get rid of the decoys	mn19	25	7	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:25.8	so that, in due course, that herd of deer would grow, increase, and mature.	mn19	25	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	mn19	26	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.2	And this is what it means.	mn19	26	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.3	‘An expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures.	mn19	26	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.4	‘A large herd of deer’ is a term for sentient beings.	mn19	26	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.5	‘A person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them’ is a term for Māra the Wicked.	mn19	26	5	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.6	‘The wrong path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is,	mn19	26	6	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.7	wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion.	mn19	26	7	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.8	‘A domesticated male deer’ is a term for greed and relishing.	mn19	26	8	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.9	‘A domesticated female deer’ is a term for ignorance.	mn19	26	9	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.10	‘A person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn19	26	10	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.11	‘The safe, secure path that leads to happiness’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is:	mn19	26	11	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.12	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	mn19	26	12	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:26.13	So, mendicants, I have opened up the safe, secure path to happiness and closed off the wrong path. And I have got rid of the male and female decoys.	mn19	26	13	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:27.1	Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.	mn19	27	1	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:27.2	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”	mn19	27	2	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:27.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn19	27	3	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn19:27.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn19	27	4	mn	19	Two Kinds of Thought
mn20:1.1	So I have heard.	mn20	1	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn20	1	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn20	1	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn20	1	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn20	1	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn20	1	6	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five subjects from time to time.	mn20	2	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:2.2	What five?	mn20	2	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:3.1	Take a mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. That mendicant should focus on some other subject connected with the skillful.	mn20	3	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:3.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	3	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:3.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	3	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:3.4	It’s like a deft mason or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg.	mn20	3	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:3.5	In the same way, a mendicant … should focus on some other basis of meditation connected with the skillful …	mn20	3	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other subject connected with the skillful, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts:	mn20	4	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.2	‘So these thoughts are unskillful, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’	mn20	4	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.3	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	4	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	4	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.5	Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted.	mn20	4	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:4.6	In the same way, a mendicant … should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts …	mn20	4	6	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should try to forget and ignore them.	mn20	5	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	5	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	5	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.4	Suppose there was a person with clear eyes, and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision.	mn20	5	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.5	They’d just close their eyes or look away.	mn20	5	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:5.6	In the same way, a mendicant … those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end …	mn20	5	6	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts.	mn20	6	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.2	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	6	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	6	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.4	Suppose there was a person walking quickly.	mn20	6	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.5	They’d think:	mn20	6	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.6	‘Why am I walking so quickly?	mn20	6	6	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.7	Why don’t I slow down?’	mn20	6	7	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.8	So they’d slow down.	mn20	6	8	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.9	They’d think:	mn20	6	9	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.10	‘Why am I walking slowly?	mn20	6	10	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.11	Why don’t I stand still?’	mn20	6	11	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.12	So they’d stand still.	mn20	6	12	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.13	They’d think:	mn20	6	13	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.14	‘Why am I standing still?	mn20	6	14	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.15	Why don’t I sit down?’	mn20	6	15	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.16	So they’d sit down.	mn20	6	16	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.17	They’d think:	mn20	6	17	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.18	‘Why am I sitting?	mn20	6	18	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.19	Why don’t I lie down?’	mn20	6	19	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.20	So they’d lie down.	mn20	6	20	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.21	And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones.	mn20	6	21	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:6.22	In the same way, a mendicant … those thoughts are given up and come to an end …	mn20	6	22	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.1	Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up.	mn20	7	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.2	With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.	mn20	7	2	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.3	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	7	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	7	4	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.5	It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	mn20	7	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.6	In the same way, a mendicant …	mn20	7	6	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.7	with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.	mn20	7	7	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.8	As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	7	8	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:7.9	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	7	9	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.1	Now, take the mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. They focus on some other subject connected with the skillful …	mn20	8	1	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.3	They examine the drawbacks of those thoughts …	mn20	8	3	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.5	They try to forget and ignore about those thoughts …	mn20	8	5	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.7	They focus on stopping the formation of thoughts …	mn20	8	7	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.9	With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. When they succeed in each of these things, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end.	mn20	8	9	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.10	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn20	8	10	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.11	This is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thought.	mn20	8	11	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.12	They will think what they want to think, and they won’t think what they don’t want to think.	mn20	8	12	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.13	They’ve cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering.”	mn20	8	13	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.14	That is what the Buddha said.	mn20	8	14	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn20:8.15	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn20	8	15	mn	20	How to Stop Thinking
mn21:1.1	So I have heard.	mn21	1	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn21	1	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:2.1	Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was spending too long mixing closely with some nuns.	mn21	2	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:2.2	So much so that	mn21	2	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:2.3	if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.	mn21	2	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:2.4	And if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the Top-Knot in their presence, those nuns got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.	mn21	2	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:2.5	That’s how close Phagguna of the Top-Knot was with those nuns.	mn21	2	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was going on.	mn21	3	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	mn21	4	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that	mn21	4	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.3	the teacher summons him.”	mn21	4	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot and said to him,	mn21	4	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.5	“Reverend Phagguna, the teacher summons you.”	mn21	4	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:4.6	“Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	mn21	4	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.1	“Is it really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been spending too long mixing closely with some nuns?	mn21	5	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.2	So much so that	mn21	5	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.3	if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?	mn21	5	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.4	And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?	mn21	5	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.5	Is that how close you’ve become with those nuns?”	mn21	5	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.6	“Yes, sir.”	mn21	5	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.7	“Phagguna, are you not a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness?”	mn21	5	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:5.8	“Yes, sir.”	mn21	5	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.1	“As such, it’s not appropriate for you to mix so closely with those nuns.	mn21	6	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.2	So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	mn21	6	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.3	If that happens, you should train like this:	mn21	6	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.4	‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	mn21	6	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.5	That’s how you should train.	mn21	6	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.6	So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	mn21	6	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.7	If that happens, you should train like this:	mn21	6	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.8	‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	mn21	6	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.9	That’s how you should train.	mn21	6	9	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.10	So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	mn21	6	10	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.11	If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	mn21	6	11	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.12	That’s how you should train.	mn21	6	12	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.13	So Phagguna, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.	mn21	6	13	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.14	If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’	mn21	6	14	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:6.15	That’s how you should train.”	mn21	6	15	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	mn21	7	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.2	“Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants.	mn21	7	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.3	Once, I addressed them:	mn21	7	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.4	‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.	mn21	7	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.5	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn21	7	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.6	You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.	mn21	7	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.7	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’	mn21	7	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.8	I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;	mn21	7	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.9	I just had to prompt their mindfulness.	mn21	7	9	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.10	Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.	mn21	7	10	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.11	A deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.	mn21	7	11	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.12	In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;	mn21	7	12	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.13	I just had to prompt their mindfulness.	mn21	7	13	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.14	So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.	mn21	7	14	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:7.15	In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.	mn21	7	15	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.1	Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees	mn21	8	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.2	that was choked with castor-oil weeds.	mn21	8	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.3	Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove.	mn21	8	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.4	They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove,	mn21	8	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.5	and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings.	mn21	8	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.6	In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature.	mn21	8	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.7	In the same way, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.	mn21	8	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:8.8	In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.	mn21	8	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā.	mn21	9	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.2	She had this good reputation:	mn21	9	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.3	‘The housewife Vedehikā is sweet, even-tempered, and calm.’	mn21	9	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.4	Now, Vedehikā had a bonded maid named Kāḷī who was deft, tireless, and well-organized in her work.	mn21	9	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.5	Then Kāḷī thought,	mn21	9	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.6	‘My mistress has a good reputation as being	mn21	9	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.7	sweet, even-tempered, and calm.	mn21	9	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.8	But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger?	mn21	9	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.9	Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?	mn21	9	9	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.10	Why don’t I test my mistress?’	mn21	9	10	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.11	So Kāḷī got up during the day.	mn21	9	11	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.12	Vedehikā said to her,	mn21	9	12	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.13	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	mn21	9	13	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.14	‘What is it, ma’am?’	mn21	9	14	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.15	‘You’re getting up in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	mn21	9	15	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.16	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	mn21	9	16	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.17	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled.	mn21	9	17	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.18	Then Kāḷī thought,	mn21	9	18	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.19	‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.	mn21	9	19	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.20	It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.	mn21	9	20	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.21	Why don’t I test my mistress further?’	mn21	9	21	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.22	So Kāḷī got up later in the day.	mn21	9	22	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.23	Vedehikā said to her,	mn21	9	23	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.24	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	mn21	9	24	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.25	‘What is it, ma’am?’	mn21	9	25	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.26	‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	mn21	9	26	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.27	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	mn21	9	27	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.28	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words.	mn21	9	28	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.29	Then Kāḷī thought,	mn21	9	29	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.30	‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.	mn21	9	30	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.31	It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.	mn21	9	31	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.32	Why don’t I test my mistress further?’	mn21	9	32	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.33	So Kāḷī got up even later in the day.	mn21	9	33	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.34	Vedehikā said to her,	mn21	9	34	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.35	‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’	mn21	9	35	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.36	‘What is it, ma’am?’	mn21	9	36	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.37	‘You’re getting up even later in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’	mn21	9	37	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.38	‘Nothing, ma’am.’	mn21	9	38	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.39	‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a door-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.	mn21	9	39	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.40	Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors,	mn21	9	40	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.41	‘See, ladies, what the sweet one did!	mn21	9	41	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.42	See what the even-tempered one did! See what the calm one did!	mn21	9	42	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.43	How on earth can she grab a door-pin and hit her only maid on the head, cracking it open, just for getting up late?’	mn21	9	43	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.44	Then after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputation:	mn21	9	44	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:9.45	‘The housewife Vedehikā is fierce, ill-tempered, and not calm at all.’	mn21	9	45	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.1	In the same way, a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism.	mn21	10	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.2	But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really sweet, even-tempered, and calm.	mn21	10	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.3	I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	mn21	10	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.4	Why is that?	mn21	10	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.5	Because when they don’t get robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish.	mn21	10	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.6	But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish.	mn21	10	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.7	So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching.’	mn21	10	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:10.8	That’s how you should train.	mn21	10	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.1	Mendicants, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.	mn21	11	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.2	Their speech may be timely or untimely,	mn21	11	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.3	true or false,	mn21	11	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.4	gentle or harsh,	mn21	11	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.5	beneficial or harmful,	mn21	11	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.6	from a heart of love or from secret hate.	mn21	11	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.7	When others criticize you, they may do so in any of these ways.	mn21	11	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.12	If that happens, you should train like this:	mn21	11	12	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.13	‘Our minds will not degenerate. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.	mn21	11	13	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.14	We will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’	mn21	11	14	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:11.15	That’s how you should train.	mn21	11	15	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.1	Suppose a person was to come along carrying a spade and basket	mn21	12	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.2	and say,	mn21	12	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.3	‘I shall make this great earth be without earth!’	mn21	12	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.4	And they’d dig all over, scatter all over, spit all over, and urinate all over, saying,	mn21	12	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.5	‘Be without earth! Be without earth!’	mn21	12	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.6	What do you think, mendicants?	mn21	12	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.7	Could that person make this great earth be without earth?”	mn21	12	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.8	“No, sir.	mn21	12	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.9	Why is that?	mn21	12	9	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.10	Because this great earth is deep and limitless.	mn21	12	10	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.11	It’s not easy to make it be without earth.	mn21	12	11	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:12.12	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn21	12	12	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:13.1	“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.	mn21	13	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw

mn21:13.15	That’s how you should train.	mn21	13	15	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.1	Suppose a person was to come along with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder,	mn21	14	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.2	and say,	mn21	14	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.3	‘I shall draw pictures in space, making pictures appear there.’	mn21	14	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.4	What do you think, mendicants?	mn21	14	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw

mn21:14.6	“No, sir.	mn21	14	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.7	Why is that?	mn21	14	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.8	Because space has no form or appearance.	mn21	14	8	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:14.9	It’s not easy to draw pictures there.	mn21	14	9	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw

mn21:21.1	If you frequently reflect on this advice on the simile of the saw,	mn21	21	1	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.2	do you see any criticism, large or small, that you could not endure?”	mn21	21	2	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.3	“No, sir.”	mn21	21	3	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.4	“So, mendicants, you should frequently reflect on this advice on the simile of the saw.	mn21	21	4	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.5	This will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn21	21	5	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn21	21	6	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn21:21.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn21	21	7	mn	21	The Simile of the Saw
mn22:1.1	So I have heard.	mn22	1	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn22	1	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:2.1	Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:	mn22	2	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:2.2	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	mn22	2	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:2.3	Several mendicants heard about this.	mn22	2	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.1	They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him,	mn22	3	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.2	“Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:	mn22	3	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.3	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”	mn22	3	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.4	“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	mn22	3	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.5	Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,	mn22	3	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.6	“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.	mn22	3	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.7	In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.	mn22	3	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.8	The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn22	3	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.9	With the similes of a skeleton …	mn22	3	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.10	a scrap of meat …	mn22	3	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.11	a grass torch …	mn22	3	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.12	a pit of glowing coals …	mn22	3	12	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.13	a dream …	mn22	3	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.14	borrowed goods …	mn22	3	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.15	fruit on a tree …	mn22	3	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.16	a butcher’s knife and chopping board …	mn22	3	16	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.17	swords and spears …	mn22	3	17	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.18	a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”	mn22	3	18	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.19	But even though the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it.	mn22	3	19	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:3.21	When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	mn22	3	21	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	mn22	5	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that	mn22	5	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.3	the teacher summons him.”	mn22	5	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him,	mn22	5	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.5	“Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.”	mn22	5	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn22	5	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.7	“Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:	mn22	5	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.8	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”	mn22	5	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:5.9	“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”	mn22	5	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.1	“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?	mn22	6	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.2	Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them?	mn22	6	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.3	I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn22	6	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.4	With the similes of a skeleton …	mn22	6	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.5	a scrap of meat …	mn22	6	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.6	a grass torch …	mn22	6	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.7	a pit of glowing coals …	mn22	6	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.8	a dream …	mn22	6	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.9	borrowed goods …	mn22	6	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.10	fruit on a tree …	mn22	6	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.11	a butcher’s knife and chopping board …	mn22	6	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.12	swords and spears …	mn22	6	12	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.13	a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn22	6	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.14	But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness.	mn22	6	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:6.15	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	mn22	6	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn22	7	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	mn22	7	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.3	Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”	mn22	7	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.4	“How could that be, sir?	mn22	7	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.5	No, sir.”	mn22	7	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.6	When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	mn22	7	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.7	Knowing this, the Buddha said,	mn22	7	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.8	“Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.	mn22	7	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:7.9	I’ll question the mendicants about this.”	mn22	7	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn22	8	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.2	“Mendicants, do you understand my teaching as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness?”	mn22	8	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.3	“No, sir.	mn22	8	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.4	For in many ways the Buddha has told us that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.	mn22	8	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.6	The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn22	8	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.7	With the similes of a skeleton …	mn22	8	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.8	a snake’s head, the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”	mn22	8	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.9	“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.	mn22	8	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.10	For in many ways I have said that obstructive acts are obstructive …	mn22	8	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.13	I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.	mn22	8	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.14	But still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness.	mn22	8	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:8.15	This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.	mn22	8	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:9.1	Truly, mendicants, it is quite impossible to perform sensual acts without sensual desires, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.	mn22	9	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.1	Take a futile person who memorizes the teaching—	mn22	10	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.2	statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations.	mn22	10	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.3	But they don’t examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom,	mn22	10	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.4	and so don’t come to an acceptance of them after deliberation.	mn22	10	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.5	They memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.	mn22	10	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.6	They don’t realize the goal for which they memorized them.	mn22	10	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.7	Because they’re wrongly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering.	mn22	10	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.8	Why is that?	mn22	10	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.9	Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.	mn22	10	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.10	Suppose there was a person in need of a cobra. And while wandering in search of a cobra	mn22	10	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.11	they’d see a big cobra,	mn22	10	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.12	and grasp it by the coil or the tail.	mn22	10	12	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.13	But that cobra would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or other major or minor limb,	mn22	10	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.14	resulting in death or deadly pain.	mn22	10	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.15	Why is that?	mn22	10	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.16	Because of their wrong grasp of the cobra.	mn22	10	16	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.17	In the same way, a futile person memorizes the teaching …	mn22	10	17	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.23	and those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering.	mn22	10	23	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.24	Why is that?	mn22	10	24	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:10.25	Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.	mn22	10	25	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.1	Now, take a gentleman who memorizes the teaching—	mn22	11	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.2	statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations.	mn22	11	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.3	And once he’s memorized them, he examines their meaning with wisdom,	mn22	11	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.4	and comes to an acceptance of them after deliberation.	mn22	11	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.5	He doesn’t memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.	mn22	11	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.6	He realizes the goal for which he memorized them.	mn22	11	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.7	Because they’re correctly grasped, those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happiness.	mn22	11	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.8	Why is that?	mn22	11	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.9	Because of his correct grasp of the teachings.	mn22	11	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.10	Suppose there was a person in need of a cobra. And while wandering in search of a cobra	mn22	11	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.11	they’d see a big cobra,	mn22	11	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.12	and hold it down carefully with a cleft stick.	mn22	11	12	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.13	Only then would they correctly grasp it by the neck.	mn22	11	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.14	And even though that cobra might wrap its coils around that person’s hand or arm or some other major or minor limb, that wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain.	mn22	11	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.15	Why is that?	mn22	11	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.16	Because of their correct grasp of the cobra.	mn22	11	16	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.17	In the same way, a gentleman memorizes the teaching …	mn22	11	17	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.23	and those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happiness.	mn22	11	23	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.24	Why is that?	mn22	11	24	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:11.25	Because of his correct grasp of the teachings.	mn22	11	25	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:12.1	So, mendicants, when you understand what I’ve said, you should remember it accordingly.	mn22	12	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:12.2	But if I’ve said anything that you don’t understand, you should ask me about it, or some competent mendicants.	mn22	12	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.1	Mendicants, I will teach you a simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on.	mn22	13	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn22	13	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn22	13	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.4	The Buddha said this:	mn22	13	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.5	“Suppose there was a person traveling along the road.	mn22	13	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.6	They’d see a large deluge, whose near shore was dubious and perilous, while the far shore was a sanctuary free of peril.	mn22	13	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.7	But there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over.	mn22	13	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.8	They’d think,	mn22	13	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.11	‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’	mn22	13	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.12	And so they’d do exactly that.	mn22	13	12	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.13	And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think,	mn22	13	13	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.14	‘This raft has been very helpful to me.	mn22	13	14	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.15	Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore.	mn22	13	15	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.16	Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’	mn22	13	16	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.17	What do you think, mendicants?	mn22	13	17	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.18	Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?”	mn22	13	18	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.19	“No, sir.”	mn22	13	19	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.20	“And what, mendicants, should that person do with the raft?	mn22	13	20	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.21	When they’d crossed over they should think,	mn22	13	21	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.22	‘This raft has been very helpful to me. …	mn22	13	22	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.24	Why don’t I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want?’	mn22	13	24	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.25	That’s what that person should do with the raft.	mn22	13	25	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:13.26	In the same way, I have taught a simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on.	mn22	13	26	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:14.1	By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is not the teachings.	mn22	14	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.1	Mendicants, there are these six grounds for views.	mn22	15	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.2	What six?	mn22	15	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.3	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn22	15	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.4	They regard form as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	mn22	15	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.5	They also regard feeling …	mn22	15	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.6	perception …	mn22	15	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.7	choices …	mn22	15	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.8	whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	mn22	15	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.9	And as for this ground for views:	mn22	15	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.10	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	mn22	15	10	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:15.11	They regard this also as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’	mn22	15	11	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.1	But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn22	16	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.2	They regard form like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn22	16	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.3	They also regard feeling …	mn22	16	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.4	perception …	mn22	16	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.5	choices …	mn22	16	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.6	whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn22	16	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.7	And the same for this ground for views:	mn22	16	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.8	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	mn22	16	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:16.9	They also regard like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn22	16	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:17.1	Seeing in this way they’re not anxious about what doesn’t exist.”	mn22	17	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	mn22	18	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.2	“Sir, can there be anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally?”	mn22	18	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.3	“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.	mn22	18	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.4	“It’s when someone thinks,	mn22	18	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.5	‘Oh, it once was mine but is mine no more.	mn22	18	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.6	Oh, it could be mine but I do not get it.’	mn22	18	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.7	They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn22	18	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:18.8	That’s how there is anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally.”	mn22	18	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.1	“But can there be no anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally?”	mn22	19	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.2	“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.	mn22	19	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.3	“It’s when someone doesn’t think,	mn22	19	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.4	‘Oh, it once was mine but is mine no more.	mn22	19	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.5	Oh, it could be mine but I do not get it.’	mn22	19	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.6	They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn22	19	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:19.7	That’s how there is no anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally.”	mn22	19	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.1	“But can there be anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally?”	mn22	20	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.2	“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.	mn22	20	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.3	“It’s when someone has such a view:	mn22	20	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.4	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	mn22	20	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.5	They hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	mn22	20	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.6	They think,	mn22	20	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.7	‘Whoa, I’m going to be annihilated and destroyed! I won’t even exist any more!’	mn22	20	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.8	They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn22	20	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:20.9	That’s how there is anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally.”	mn22	20	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.1	“But can there be no anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally?”	mn22	21	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.2	“There can,” said the Buddha.	mn22	21	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.3	“It’s when someone doesn’t have such a view:	mn22	21	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.4	‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’	mn22	21	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.5	They hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	mn22	21	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.6	They don’t think,	mn22	21	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.7	‘Whoa, I’m going to be annihilated and destroyed! I won’t even exist any more!’	mn22	21	7	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.8	They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn22	21	8	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:21.9	That’s how there is no anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally.	mn22	21	9	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:22.1	Mendicants, it would make sense to be possessive about something that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.	mn22	22	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:22.2	But do you see any such possession?”	mn22	22	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:22.3	“No, sir.”	mn22	22	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:22.4	“Good, mendicants!	mn22	22	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:28.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	mn22	28	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:29.1	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn22	29	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:29.2	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn22	29	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:30.1	Such a mendicant is one who is called ‘one who has lifted the cross-bar’, ‘one who has filled in the moat’, ‘one who has pulled up the pillar’, ‘one who is unimpeded’, and also ‘a noble one with banner lowered and burden dropped, detached’.	mn22	30	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:31.1	And how has a mendicant raised the cross-bar?	mn22	31	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:31.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	mn22	31	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:31.3	That’s how a mendicant has lifted the cross-bar.	mn22	31	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:32.3	That’s how a mendicant has filled in the moat.	mn22	32	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:33.3	That’s how a mendicant has pulled up the pillar.	mn22	33	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:34.1	And how is a mendicant unimpeded?	mn22	34	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:34.2	It’s when a mendicant has given up the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.	mn22	34	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:34.3	That’s how a mendicant is unimpeded.	mn22	34	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:36.1	When a mendicant’s mind was freed like this, the gods together with Indra, the Divinity, and the Progenitor, search as they may, will not discover:	mn22	36	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:36.2	‘This is the basis of that realized one’s consciousness.’	mn22	36	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:36.3	Why is that?	mn22	36	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:36.4	Because even in this very life that realized one is not found, I say.	mn22	36	4	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:37.1	Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the incorrect, hollow, false, untruthful claim:	mn22	37	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:37.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is an exterminator. He advocates the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being.’	mn22	37	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:37.3	They misrepresent me as what I am not, and saying what I do not say.	mn22	37	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:37.5	In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.	mn22	37	5	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:37.6	This being so, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the Realized One, he doesn’t get resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.	mn22	37	6	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:38.1	Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate him, he doesn’t get thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.	mn22	38	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:38.2	If they praise him, he just thinks,	mn22	38	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:38.3	‘They do such things for me regarding what in the past was completely understood.’	mn22	38	3	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:39.1	So, mendicants, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble you, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.	mn22	39	1	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:39.2	Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate you, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.	mn22	39	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:41.16	“No, sir.	mn22	41	16	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra
mn22:41.17	Why is that?	mn22	41	17	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn22:42.2	In this teaching there are mendicants who are perfected, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.

mn22:44.2	In this teaching there are mendicants who, having given up three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. All of them come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. …	mn22	44	2	mn	22	The Simile of the Cobra

mn23:4.41	Satisfied, Venerable Kassapa the Prince approved what the Buddha said.	mn23	4	41	mn	23	The Termite Mound
mn24:1.1	So I have heard.	mn24	1	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn24	1	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:2.1	Then several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:	mn24	2	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:2.2	“In your native land, mendicants, which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this way:	mn24	2	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:2.3	‘Personally having few wishes, they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes. Personally having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom, they speak to the mendicants on all these things. They’re an adviser and counselor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires their spiritual companions.’”	mn24	2	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:2.4	“Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī, sir, is esteemed in this way in our native land.”	mn24	2	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha.	mn24	3	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:3.2	Then he thought:	mn24	3	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:3.3	“Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī is fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn24	3	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:3.4	in that his sensible spiritual companions praise him point by point in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher seconds that appreciation.	mn24	3	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:3.5	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa, and we can have a discussion.”	mn24	3	5	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:4.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he pleased, he set out for Sāvatthī.	mn24	4	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:4.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,	mn24	4	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:4.3	where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn24	4	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:4.4	Puṇṇa heard that the Buddha had arrived at Sāvatthī.	mn24	4	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:5.1	Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.	mn24	5	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:5.2	Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	mn24	5	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:5.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	mn24	5	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:5.4	Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.	mn24	5	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:6.1	Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and said to him,	mn24	6	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:6.2	“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Buddha’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”	mn24	6	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:7.1	Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head.	mn24	7	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:7.2	Puṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	mn24	7	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:7.3	And Sāriputta did likewise.	mn24	7	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:8.1	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Puṇṇa, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn24	8	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Puṇṇa:	mn24	8	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.1	“Reverend, is our spiritual life lived under the Buddha?”	mn24	9	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.2	“Yes, reverend.”	mn24	9	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.3	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of ethics?”	mn24	9	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.4	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.5	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of mind?”	mn24	9	5	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.6	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	6	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.7	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of view?”	mn24	9	7	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.8	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	8	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.9	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification by traversing doubt?”	mn24	9	9	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.10	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	10	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.11	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path?”	mn24	9	11	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.12	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	12	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.13	“Well, is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice?”	mn24	9	13	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.14	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	14	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.15	“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision?”	mn24	9	15	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:9.16	“Certainly not.”	mn24	9	16	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:10.1	“When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’	mn24	10	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:10.8	Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha?”	mn24	10	8	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:10.9	“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is extinguishment by not grasping.”	mn24	10	9	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.1	“Reverend, is purification of ethics extinguishment by not grasping?”	mn24	11	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.2	“Certainly not, reverend.”	mn24	11	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.3	“Is purification of mind …	mn24	11	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.5	purification of view …	mn24	11	5	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.7	purification by traversing doubt …	mn24	11	7	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready

mn24:11.11	purification of knowledge and vision of the practice …	mn24	11	11	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.13	Is purification of knowledge and vision extinguishment by not grasping?”	mn24	11	13	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.14	“Certainly not.”	mn24	11	14	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.15	“Then is extinguishment by not grasping something apart from these things?”	mn24	11	15	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:11.16	“Certainly not.”	mn24	11	16	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:12.1	“When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’	mn24	12	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:12.9	How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”	mn24	12	9	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.1	“If the Buddha had declared purification of ethics to be extinguishment by not grasping, he would have declared that which has fuel for grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping.	mn24	13	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.2	If the Buddha had declared purification of mind …	mn24	13	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.3	purification of view …	mn24	13	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.4	purification by traversing doubt …	mn24	13	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready

mn24:13.7	If the Buddha had declared purification of knowledge and vision to be extinguishment by not grasping, he would have declared that which has fuel for grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping.	mn24	13	7	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.8	But if extinguishment by not grasping was something apart from these things, an ordinary person would become extinguished.	mn24	13	8	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:13.9	For an ordinary person lacks these things.	mn24	13	9	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.1	Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile.	mn24	14	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.2	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	mn24	14	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.3	Suppose that, while staying in Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi of Kosala had some urgent business come up in Sāketa.	mn24	14	3	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.4	Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven chariots were stationed at the ready for him.	mn24	14	4	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.5	Then Pasenadi, having departed Sāvatthī, mounted the first chariot at the ready by the gate of the royal compound. The first chariot at the ready would bring him to the second, where he’d dismount and mount the second chariot.	mn24	14	5	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.6	The second chariot at the ready would bring him to the third …	mn24	14	6	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.7	The third chariot at the ready would bring him to the fourth …	mn24	14	7	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.8	The fourth chariot at the ready would bring him to the fifth …	mn24	14	8	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:14.9	The fifth chariot at the ready would bring him to the sixth …	mn24	14	9	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready

mn24:14.26	That’s how King Pasenadi should rightly reply.”	mn24	14	26	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:15.1	“In the same way, reverend, purification of ethics is only for the sake of purification of mind. Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view. Purification of view is only for the sake of purification by traversing doubt. Purification by traversing doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. Purification of knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice.

mn24:16.5	“It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing!	mn24	16	5	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:16.6	Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī has answered each deep question point by point, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions.	mn24	16	6	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:16.7	It is fortunate for his spiritual companions, so very fortunate,	mn24	16	7	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:16.8	that they get to see Venerable Puṇṇa son of Mantāṇī and pay homage to him.	mn24	16	8	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:16.9	Even if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them!

mn24:17.1	When he said this, Puṇṇa said to Sāriputta,	mn24	17	1	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn24:17.2	“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your spiritual companions?”	mn24	17	2	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready

mn24:17.13	And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.	mn24	17	13	mn	24	Chariots at the Ready
mn25:1.1	So I have heard.	mn25	1	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn25	1	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn25	1	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn25	1	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn25	1	5	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn25	1	6	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:2.1	“Mendicants, a sower does not sow seed for deer thinking,	mn25	2	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:2.2	‘May the deer, enjoying this seed, be long-lived and beautiful. May they live long and prosper!’	mn25	2	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:2.3	A sower sows seed for deer thinking,	mn25	2	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:2.4	‘When these deer encroach on where I sow the seed, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this seed.’	mn25	2	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:3.1	And indeed, the first herd of deer encroached on where the sower sowed the seed and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the sower was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed.	mn25	3	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:3.2	And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power.	mn25	3	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.1	So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan,	mn25	4	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.2	‘The first herd of deer became indulgent …	mn25	4	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.4	and failed to get free of the sower’s power.	mn25	4	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.5	Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’	mn25	4	5	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.6	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	4	6	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.7	But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,	mn25	4	7	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.8	and they lost their strength and energy.	mn25	4	8	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.9	So they returned to where the sower had sown the seed.	mn25	4	9	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.10	Encroaching, they recklessly enjoyed eating it …	mn25	4	10	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:4.12	And that’s how the second herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power.	mn25	4	12	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.1	So then a third herd of deer thought up a plan,	mn25	5	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.2	‘The first …	mn25	5	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.4	and second herds of deer …	mn25	5	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.14	failed to get free of the sower’s power.	mn25	5	14	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.15	Why don’t we set up our lair close by where the sower has sown the seed?	mn25	5	15	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.16	Then we can encroach and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed.’	mn25	5	16	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.17	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	5	17	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.19	So the sower and his helpers thought,	mn25	5	19	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.20	‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!	mn25	5	20	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.21	For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go.	mn25	5	21	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.22	Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’	mn25	5	22	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.23	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	5	23	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.24	And they saw the lair where the third herd of deer went to hide out.	mn25	5	24	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:5.25	And that’s how the third herd failed to get free from the sower’s power.	mn25	5	25	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.1	So then a fourth herd of deer thought up a plan,	mn25	6	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.2	‘The first …	mn25	6	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.4	second …	mn25	6	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.10	and third herds of deer …	mn25	6	10	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.27	failed to get free of the sower’s power.	mn25	6	27	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.28	Why don’t we set up our lair somewhere the sower and his helpers can’t go? Then we can intrude on where the sower has sown the seed and enjoy eating it without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do with us what he wants on account of that seed.’	mn25	6	28	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.29	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	6	29	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.31	So the sower and his helpers thought,	mn25	6	31	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.32	‘Wow, this fourth herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!	mn25	6	32	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.33	For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go.	mn25	6	33	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.34	Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’	mn25	6	34	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.35	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	6	35	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.36	But they couldn’t see the lair where the fourth herd of deer went to hide out.	mn25	6	36	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.37	So the sower and his helpers thought,	mn25	6	37	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.38	‘If we disturb this fourth herd of deer, they’ll disturb others, who in turn will disturb even more.	mn25	6	38	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.39	Then all of the deer will escape this seed we’ve sown.	mn25	6	39	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.40	Why don’t we just keep an eye on that fourth herd?’	mn25	6	40	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.41	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	6	41	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:6.42	And that’s how the fourth herd of deer escaped the sower’s power.	mn25	6	42	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	mn25	7	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.2	And this is what it means.	mn25	7	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.3	‘Seed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn25	7	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.4	‘Sower’ is a term for Māra the Wicked.	mn25	7	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.5	‘Sower’s helpers’ is a term for Māra’s assembly.	mn25	7	5	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:7.6	‘Deer’ is a term for ascetics and brahmins.	mn25	7	6	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:8.1	Now, the first group of ascetics and brahmins encroached on where the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh were sown by Māra and recklessly enjoyed eating it.	mn25	8	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:8.2	They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then Māra was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh.	mn25	8	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:8.3	And that’s how the first group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.	mn25	8	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:8.4	This first group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the first herd of deer, I say.	mn25	8	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.1	So then a second group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,	mn25	9	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.2	‘The first group of ascetics and brahmins became indulgent …	mn25	9	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.4	and failed to get free of Māra’s power.	mn25	9	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.5	Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’	mn25	9	5	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.7	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	9	7	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.8	They ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	mn25	9	8	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.9	But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,	mn25	9	9	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.10	and they lost their strength and energy.	mn25	9	10	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.11	Because of this, they lost their heart’s release,	mn25	9	11	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.12	so they went back to where Māra had sown the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh.	mn25	9	12	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.13	Intruding on that place, they recklessly enjoyed eating them …	mn25	9	13	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.15	And that’s how the second group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.	mn25	9	15	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:9.16	This second group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the second herd of deer, I say.	mn25	9	16	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.1	So then a third group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,	mn25	10	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.2	‘The first …	mn25	10	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.4	and second groups of ascetics and brahmins …	mn25	10	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.15	failed to get free of Māra’s power.	mn25	10	15	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.16	Why don’t we set up our lair close by where Māra has sown the seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh? Then we can encroach on it and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then Māra won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh.’	mn25	10	16	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.17	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	10	17	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.20	Still, they had such views as these:	mn25	10	20	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.21	‘The cosmos is eternal’ or ‘The cosmos is not eternal’;	mn25	10	21	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.22	‘The cosmos is finite’ or ‘The cosmos is infinite’;	mn25	10	22	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.23	‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’;	mn25	10	23	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.24	or that after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.	mn25	10	24	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.25	And that’s how the third group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.	mn25	10	25	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:10.26	This third group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the third herd of deer, I say.	mn25	10	26	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.1	So then a fourth group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,	mn25	11	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.2	‘The first …	mn25	11	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.4	second …	mn25	11	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.10	and third groups of ascetics and brahmins …	mn25	11	10	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.26	failed to get free of Māra’s power.	mn25	11	26	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.27	Why don’t we set up our lair where Māra and his assembly can’t go?	mn25	11	27	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.28	Then we can encroach on where Māra has sown the seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh, and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then Māra won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh.’	mn25	11	28	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.29	And that’s just what they did.	mn25	11	29	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.31	And that’s how the fourth group of ascetics and brahmins got free from Māra’s power.	mn25	11	31	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:11.32	This fourth group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the fourth herd of deer, I say.	mn25	11	32	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:12.1	And where is it that Māra and his assembly can’t go?	mn25	12	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:12.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn25	12	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:12.3	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.	mn25	12	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:13.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn25	13	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:13.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	13	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:14.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn25	14	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:14.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	14	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:15.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn25	15	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:15.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	15	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:16.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	mn25	16	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:16.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	16	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:17.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	mn25	17	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:17.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	17	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:18.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	mn25	18	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:18.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	18	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:19.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn25	19	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:19.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn25	19	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:20.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	mn25	20	1	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:20.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”	mn25	20	2	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:20.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn25	20	3	mn	25	Sowing
mn25:20.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn25	20	4	mn	25	Sowing
mn26:1.1	So I have heard.	mn26	1	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn26	1	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn26	2	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.2	Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him,	mn26	2	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.3	“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.	mn26	2	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.4	It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”	mn26	2	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.5	“Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.	mn26	2	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.6	Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”	mn26	2	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:2.7	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn26	2	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.1	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha addressed Ānanda,	mn26	3	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.”	mn26	3	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	mn26	3	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.4	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.	mn26	3	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.5	In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,	mn26	3	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.6	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”	mn26	3	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.7	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	mn26	3	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.8	So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.	mn26	3	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.9	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	mn26	3	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.10	Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,	mn26	3	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.11	“Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby.	mn26	3	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.12	It’s so delightful,	mn26	3	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.13	so lovely.	mn26	3	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.14	Please visit it out of sympathy.”	mn26	3	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:3.15	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn26	3	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.1	He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.	mn26	4	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.2	Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching.	mn26	4	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.3	The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.	mn26	4	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.4	When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel.	mn26	4	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.5	The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,	mn26	4	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.6	and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out	mn26	4	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.7	and addressed the mendicants,	mn26	4	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.8	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn26	4	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.9	“Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.”	mn26	4	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.10	“Good, mendicants!	mn26	4	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.11	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching.	mn26	4	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.12	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	mn26	4	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:4.13	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.	mn26	4	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:5.1	Mendicants, there are these two quests:	mn26	5	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:5.2	the noble quest and the ignoble quest.	mn26	5	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:5.3	And what is the ignoble quest?	mn26	5	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:5.4	It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things.	mn26	5	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:6.1	And what should be described as liable to be reborn?	mn26	6	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:6.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to be reborn.	mn26	6	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:6.3	These attachments are liable to be reborn.	mn26	6	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:6.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn.	mn26	6	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:7.1	And what should be described as liable to grow old?	mn26	7	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:7.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to grow old.	mn26	7	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:7.3	These attachments are liable to grow old.	mn26	7	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:7.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old.	mn26	7	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:8.1	And what should be described as liable to fall sick?	mn26	8	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:8.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick.	mn26	8	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:8.3	These attachments are liable to fall sick.	mn26	8	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:8.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to falling sick, seeks what is also liable to fall sick.	mn26	8	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:9.1	And what should be described as liable to die?	mn26	9	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:9.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to die.	mn26	9	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:9.3	These attachments are liable to die.	mn26	9	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:9.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to die, seeks what is also liable to die.	mn26	9	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:10.1	And what should be described as liable to sorrow?	mn26	10	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:10.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to sorrow.	mn26	10	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:10.3	These attachments are liable to sorrow.	mn26	10	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:10.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to sorrow, seeks what is also liable to sorrow.	mn26	10	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:11.1	And what should be described as liable to corruption?	mn26	11	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:11.2	Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to corruption.	mn26	11	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:11.3	These attachments are liable to corruption.	mn26	11	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:11.4	Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption.	mn26	11	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:11.5	This is the ignoble quest.	mn26	11	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:12.1	And what is the noble quest?	mn26	12	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:12.2	It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, seeks that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment.	mn26	12	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:12.3	This is the noble quest.	mn26	12	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:13.1	Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too, being liable to be reborn, sought what is also liable to be reborn. Myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, I sought what is also liable to these things.	mn26	13	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:13.2	Then it occurred to me:	mn26	13	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:13.3	‘Why do I, being liable to be reborn, grow old, fall sick, sorrow, die, and become corrupted, seek things that have the same nature?	mn26	13	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:13.4	Why don’t I seek that which is free of rebirth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment?’	mn26	13	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:14.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn26	14	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.1	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn26	15	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn26	15	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.3	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	mn26	15	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.4	‘Stay, venerable.	mn26	15	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn26	15	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn26	15	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn26	15	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.8	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	15	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn26	15	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.10	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn26	15	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.11	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn26	15	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.12	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	mn26	15	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.13	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	mn26	15	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.14	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	15	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.15	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	mn26	15	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.16	energy,	mn26	15	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.17	mindfulness,	mn26	15	17	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.18	immersion,	mn26	15	18	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn26	15	19	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	mn26	15	20	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn26	15	21	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.22	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn26	15	22	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.23	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	mn26	15	23	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.24	‘I have, reverend.’	mn26	15	24	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.25	‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn26	15	25	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn26	15	26	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn26	15	27	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.28	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn26	15	28	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.29	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	mn26	15	29	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.30	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching that you know, I know.	mn26	15	30	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.31	I am like you and you are like me.	mn26	15	31	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.32	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	mn26	15	32	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.33	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	mn26	15	33	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.34	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	15	34	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.35	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	mn26	15	35	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:15.36	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn26	15	36	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn26	16	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn26	16	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.3	Uddaka replied,	mn26	16	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.4	‘Stay, venerable.	mn26	16	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn26	16	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn26	16	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn26	16	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.8	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	16	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn26	16	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn26	16	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.11	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn26	16	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	mn26	16	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn26	16	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.14	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	16	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	mn26	16	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.16	energy,	mn26	16	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.17	mindfulness,	mn26	16	17	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.18	immersion,	mn26	16	18	mn	26	The Noble Quest

mn26:16.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	mn26	16	20	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn26	16	21	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.22	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn26	16	22	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.23	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	mn26	16	23	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.24	‘He had, reverend.’	mn26	16	24	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.25	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn26	16	25	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn26	16	26	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn26	16	27	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.28	So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn26	16	28	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.29	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	mn26	16	29	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.30	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	mn26	16	30	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.31	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	mn26	16	31	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.32	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	mn26	16	32	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.33	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	mn26	16	33	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.34	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	16	34	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.35	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	mn26	16	35	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:16.36	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn26	16	36	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	mn26	17	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	mn26	17	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.3	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	17	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	mn26	17	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	mn26	17	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.6	So I sat down right there, thinking,	mn26	17	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:17.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	mn26	17	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:18.1	And so, being myself liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, I sought that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and I found it. Being myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, I sought that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and I found it.	mn26	18	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:18.2	Knowledge and vision arose in me:	mn26	18	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:18.3	‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	mn26	18	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	19	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.2	‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	mn26	19	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.3	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	mn26	19	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.4	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	mn26	19	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.5	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	mn26	19	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.6	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’	mn26	19	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.7	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	mn26	19	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.8	‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	mn26	19	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.9	enough with trying to explain it!	mn26	19	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.10	Those mired in greed and hate	mn26	19	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.11	can’t really understand this teaching.	mn26	19	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.12	It goes against the stream, subtle,	mn26	19	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.13	deep, obscure, and very fine.	mn26	19	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.14	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	mn26	19	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.15	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’	mn26	19	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:19.16	So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	mn26	19	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, thought,	mn26	20	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.2	‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’	mn26	20	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.3	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me.	mn26	20	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said,	mn26	20	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.5	‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	mn26	20	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	mn26	20	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!’	mn26	20	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.8	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	mn26	20	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.9	Then he went on to say:	mn26	20	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.10	‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	mn26	20	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.11	an impure teaching thought up by the stained.	mn26	20	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.12	Fling open the door to freedom from death!	mn26	20	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.13	Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered.	mn26	20	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.14	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	mn26	20	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.15	you can see the people all around.	mn26	20	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.16	In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,	mn26	20	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.17	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	mn26	20	17	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.18	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	mn26	20	18	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.19	swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.	mn26	20	19	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.20	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, caravan leader,	mn26	20	20	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.21	wander the world cleared of debt.	mn26	20	21	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.22	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	mn26	20	22	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:20.23	There will be those who understand!’	mn26	20	23	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.1	Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.	mn26	21	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.2	And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	mn26	21	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	mn26	21	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.4	In the same way, I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.	mn26	21	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.5	Then I replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:	mn26	21	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.6	‘Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	mn26	21	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.7	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	mn26	21	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.8	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	mn26	21	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.9	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.’	mn26	21	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:21.10	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.	mn26	21	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.1	Then I thought,	mn26	22	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn26	22	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	mn26	22	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	22	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.5	‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	mn26	22	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	mn26	22	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	mn26	22	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.8	But a deity came to me and said,	mn26	22	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.9	‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	mn26	22	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	mn26	22	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.11	‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	mn26	22	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.12	I thought,	mn26	22	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.13	‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.	mn26	22	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:22.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	mn26	22	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.1	Then I thought,	mn26	23	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn26	23	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	mn26	23	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	23	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.5	‘That Uddaka son of Rāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	mn26	23	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	mn26	23	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	mn26	23	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.8	But a deity came to me and said,	mn26	23	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.9	‘Sir, Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last night.’	mn26	23	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	mn26	23	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.11	‘Uddaka son of Rāma passed away just last night.’	mn26	23	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.12	I thought,	mn26	23	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.13	‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.	mn26	23	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:23.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	mn26	23	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.1	Then I thought,	mn26	24	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn26	24	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.3	Who will quickly understand this teaching?’	mn26	24	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn26	24	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.5	‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.	mn26	24	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.6	Why don’t I teach them first of all?’	mn26	24	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.7	Then I thought,	mn26	24	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.8	‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’	mn26	24	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.9	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	mn26	24	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:24.10	So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I pleased, I set out for Varanasi.	mn26	24	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.1	While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me	mn26	25	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.2	and said,	mn26	25	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.3	‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	mn26	25	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.4	In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’	mn26	25	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.5	I replied to Upaka in verse:	mn26	25	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.6	‘I am the champion, the knower of all,	mn26	25	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.7	unsullied in the midst of all things.	mn26	25	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.8	I’ve given up all, freed through the ending of craving.	mn26	25	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.9	Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?	mn26	25	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.10	I have no tutor.	mn26	25	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.11	There is no-one like me.	mn26	25	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.12	In the world with its gods,	mn26	25	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.13	I have no rival.	mn26	25	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.14	For in this world, I am the perfected one;	mn26	25	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.15	I am the supreme Teacher.	mn26	25	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.16	I alone am fully awakened,	mn26	25	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.17	cooled, quenched.	mn26	25	17	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.18	I am going to the city of Kāsi	mn26	25	18	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.19	to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.	mn26	25	19	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.20	In this world that is so blind,	mn26	25	20	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.21	I’ll beat the drum of freedom from death!’	mn26	25	21	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.22	‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’	mn26	25	22	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.23	‘The victors are those who, like me,	mn26	25	23	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.24	have reached the ending of defilements.	mn26	25	24	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.25	I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—	mn26	25	25	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.26	that’s why I’m a victor.’	mn26	25	26	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:25.27	When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.	mn26	25	27	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.1	Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Varanasi, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.	mn26	26	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.2	The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance	mn26	26	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.3	and stopped each other, saying,	mn26	26	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.4	‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	mn26	26	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.5	We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.	mn26	26	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.6	But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’	mn26	26	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.7	Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.	mn26	26	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.8	Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.	mn26	26	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:26.9	But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.	mn26	26	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.1	So I said to them,	mn26	27	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.2	‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as “reverend”.	mn26	27	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.3	The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn26	27	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.4	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn26	27	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.5	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn26	27	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.6	But they said to me,	mn26	27	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.7	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’	mn26	27	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.8	So I said to them,	mn26	27	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.9	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	mn26	27	9	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.10	The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn26	27	10	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.11	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn26	27	11	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.12	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.’	mn26	27	12	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.13	But for a second time they said to me,	mn26	27	13	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.14	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve returned to indulgence.’	mn26	27	14	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.15	So for a second time I said to them,	mn26	27	15	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.16	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’	mn26	27	16	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.18	But for a third time they said to me,	mn26	27	18	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:27.19	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’	mn26	27	19	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.1	So I said to them,	mn26	28	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.2	‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’	mn26	28	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.3	‘No sir, we have not.’	mn26	28	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.4	‘The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn26	28	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.5	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn26	28	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:28.6	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn26	28	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:29.1	I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.	mn26	29	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:29.2	Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.	mn26	29	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:29.3	Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	mn26	29	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:29.4	Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.	mn26	29	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:29.5	Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	mn26	29	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:30.1	As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, being themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, they sought that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and they found it. Being themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they sought that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment—and they found it.	mn26	30	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:30.2	Knowledge and vision arose in them:	mn26	30	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:30.3	‘Our freedom is unshakable; this is our last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’	mn26	30	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.1	Mendicants, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn26	31	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.2	What five?	mn26	31	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn26	31	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.4	Sounds known by the ear …	mn26	31	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.5	Smells known by the nose …	mn26	31	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn26	31	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn26	31	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:31.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn26	31	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.1	There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they	mn26	32	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.2	have met with calamity and disaster, and the Wicked One can do with them what he wants.	mn26	32	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.3	Suppose a deer in the wilderness was lying caught on a pile of snares.	mn26	32	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.4	You’d know that it	mn26	32	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.5	has met with calamity and disaster, and the hunter can do with them what he wants.	mn26	32	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.6	And when the hunter comes, it cannot flee where it wants.	mn26	32	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.7	In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they	mn26	32	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:32.8	have met with calamity and disaster, and the Wicked One can do with them what he wants.	mn26	32	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.1	There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied, infatuated, or attached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. You should understand that they	mn26	33	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.2	haven’t met with calamity and disaster, and the Wicked One cannot do what he wants with them.	mn26	33	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.3	Suppose a deer in the wilderness was lying on a pile of snares without being caught.	mn26	33	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.4	You’d know that it	mn26	33	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.5	hasn’t met with calamity and disaster, and the hunter cannot do what he wants with them.	mn26	33	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.6	And when the hunter comes, it can flee where it wants.	mn26	33	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.7	In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied, infatuated, or attached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. You should understand that they	mn26	33	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:33.8	haven’t met with calamity and disaster, and the Wicked One cannot do what he wants with them.	mn26	33	8	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:34.1	Suppose there was a wild deer wandering in the forest that walked, stood, sat, and laid down in confidence.	mn26	34	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:34.2	Why is that?	mn26	34	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:34.3	Because it’s out of the hunter’s range.	mn26	34	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:34.4	In the same way, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn26	34	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:34.5	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.	mn26	34	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:35.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn26	35	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:35.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	35	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:36.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn26	36	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:36.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	36	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:37.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn26	37	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:37.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	37	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:38.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	mn26	38	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:38.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	38	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:39.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	mn26	39	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:39.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	39	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:40.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	mn26	40	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:40.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	40	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:41.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn26	41	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:41.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …	mn26	41	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	mn26	42	1	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.2	This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.	mn26	42	2	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.3	They’ve crossed over clinging to the world. And they walk, stand, sit, and lie down in confidence.	mn26	42	3	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.4	Why is that?	mn26	42	4	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.5	Because they’re out of the Wicked One’s range.”	mn26	42	5	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn26	42	6	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn26:42.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn26	42	7	mn	26	The Noble Quest
mn27:1.1	So I have heard.	mn27	1	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn27	1	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.	mn27	2	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.2	He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance,	mn27	2	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.3	and said to him,	mn27	2	3	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.4	“So, worthy Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	mn27	2	4	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.5	“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	mn27	2	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.6	“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”	mn27	2	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.7	“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?	mn27	2	7	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.8	You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”	mn27	2	8	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.9	“Worthy Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed.”	mn27	2	9	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.10	“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?	mn27	2	10	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.11	He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.”	mn27	2	11	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:2.12	“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?”	mn27	2	12	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.1	“Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.	mn27	3	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.2	There he’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad.	mn27	3	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.3	He would come to the conclusion,	mn27	3	3	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.4	‘This must be a big bull elephant.’	mn27	3	4	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.5	In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion,	mn27	3	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:3.6	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn27	3	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.1	What four?	mn27	4	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.2	Firstly, I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.	mn27	4	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.3	They hear,	mn27	4	3	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.4	‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’	mn27	4	4	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.5	They formulate a question, thinking,	mn27	4	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.6	‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question.	mn27	4	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.7	If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that;	mn27	4	7	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.8	and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’	mn27	4	8	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.9	When they hear that	mn27	4	9	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.10	he has come down	mn27	4	10	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.11	they approach him.	mn27	4	11	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.12	The ascetic Gotama educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.	mn27	4	12	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.13	They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer?	mn27	4	13	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.14	Invariably, they become his disciples.	mn27	4	14	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.15	When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion,	mn27	4	15	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:4.16	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn27	4	16	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:5.1	Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins …	mn27	5	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:6.1	some clever householders …	mn27	6	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:6.2	they become his disciples.	mn27	6	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.1	Furthermore, I see some clever ascetics who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. …	mn27	7	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.10	They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer?	mn27	7	10	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.11	Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth.	mn27	7	11	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.12	And he gives them the going-forth.	mn27	7	12	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.13	Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn27	7	13	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.14	They say,	mn27	7	14	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.15	‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!	mn27	7	15	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.16	For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.	mn27	7	16	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.17	But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’	mn27	7	17	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.18	When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion,	mn27	7	18	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.19	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn27	7	19	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.20	It’s because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I came to the conclusion,	mn27	7	20	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:7.21	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’”	mn27	7	21	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:8.1	When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	mn27	8	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:8.2	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn27	8	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:8.5	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion.”	mn27	8	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.1	Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn27	9	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	mn27	9	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.3	and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the wanderer Pilotika.	mn27	9	3	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.4	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	mn27	9	4	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.5	“Brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint is not yet completed in detail.	mn27	9	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.6	As to how it is completed in detail,	mn27	9	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:9.8	“Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied.	mn27	9	8	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:9.9	The Buddha said this:	mn27	9	9	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:10.1	“Suppose a bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.	mn27	10	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:10.5	Why not?	mn27	10	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:10.8	They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces high up.	mn27	10	8	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:10.21	And they see that bull elephant walking, standing, sitting, or lying down at the root of a tree or in the open.	mn27	10	21	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:10.22	Then they’d come to the conclusion,	mn27	10	22	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:11.1	In the same way, brahmin, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	mn27	11	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:11.2	He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn27	11	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:11.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely complete and pure.	mn27	11	3	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:12.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	mn27	12	1	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:12.2	They gain faith in the Realized One,	mn27	12	2	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:12.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn27	12	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:12.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn27	12	7	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:13.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword.

mn27:13.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other.

mn27:13.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.	mn27	13	6	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:13.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	mn27	13	7	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn27:27.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn27	27	4	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn27:27.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn27	27	5	mn	27	The Shorter Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.1	So I have heard.	mn28	1	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn28	1	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.3	There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants,	mn28	1	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.4	“Reverends, mendicants!”	mn28	1	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.5	“Reverend,” they replied.	mn28	1	5	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:1.6	Sāriputta said this:	mn28	1	6	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:2.1	“The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all.	mn28	2	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:2.2	In the same way, all skillful qualities are included in the four noble truths.	mn28	2	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:2.3	What four?	mn28	2	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:2.4	The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.	mn28	2	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:3.1	And what is the noble truth of suffering?	mn28	3	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:3.2	Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.	mn28	3	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:3.3	And what are the five grasping aggregates?	mn28	3	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:3.4	They are as follows: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.	mn28	3	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:4.1	And what is the grasping aggregate of form?	mn28	4	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:4.2	The four principal states, and form derived from the four principal states.	mn28	4	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:5.1	And what are the four principal states?	mn28	5	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:5.2	The elements of earth, water, fire, and air.	mn28	5	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.1	And what is the earth element?	mn28	6	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.2	The earth element may be interior or exterior.	mn28	6	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.3	And what is the interior earth element?	mn28	6	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.4	Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes:	mn28	6	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.5	head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated.	mn28	6	5	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.6	This is called the interior earth element.	mn28	6	6	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.7	The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.	mn28	6	7	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.8	This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn28	6	8	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:6.9	When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.	mn28	6	9	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:7.1	There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up.	mn28	7	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:7.2	At that time the exterior earth element vanishes.	mn28	7	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:7.3	So for all its great age, the earth element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish.	mn28	7	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:7.4	What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.	mn28	7	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:8.1	If others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand:	mn28	8	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:8.2	‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me.	mn28	8	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:8.3	That’s dependent, not independent.	mn28	8	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:8.5	Dependent on contact.’	mn28	8	5	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:8.6	They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	mn28	8	6	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:8.7	Based on that element alone, their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.	mn28	8	7	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:9.1	Others might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation,	mn28	9	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:9.2	striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords.	mn28	9	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:9.4	‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it.	mn28	9	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:9.8	Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’	mn28	9	8	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:10.1	While recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them.	mn28	10	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:10.2	In that case they stir up a sense of urgency:	mn28	10	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:10.3	‘It’s my loss, my misfortune,	mn28	10	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:10.5	They’re like a daughter-in-law who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their father-in-law.	mn28	10	5	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:10.8	But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that.	mn28	10	8	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:10.9	At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.	mn28	10	9	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:12.1	There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up.	mn28	12	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:12.2	It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions.	mn28	12	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:12.3	There comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues, or two, three, four, five, six, up to seven hundred leagues.	mn28	12	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:12.4	There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one palm tree deep.	mn28	12	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint

mn28:38.1	Though the mind is intact internally and exterior ideas come into range, so long as there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.	mn28	38	1	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.2	But when the mind is intact internally and exterior ideas come into range and there is corresponding engagement, there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.	mn28	38	2	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.3	The form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form. The feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate.	mn28	38	3	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.4	They understand:	mn28	38	4	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.5	‘So this is how there comes to be inclusion, gathering together, and joining together into these five grasping aggregates.	mn28	38	5	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.6	But the Buddha has also said:	mn28	38	6	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.7	“One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching.	mn28	38	7	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.8	One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination.”	mn28	38	8	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.9	And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated.	mn28	38	9	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.10	The desire, clinging, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering.	mn28	38	10	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.11	Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.’	mn28	38	11	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.12	At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.”	mn28	38	12	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.13	That’s what Venerable Sāriputta said.	mn28	38	13	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn28:38.14	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what Sāriputta said.	mn28	38	14	mn	28	The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint
mn29:1.1	So I have heard.	mn29	1	1	mn	29	The Longer Simile of the Heartwood
mn29:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left.	mn29	1	2	mn	29	The Longer Simile of the Heartwood
mn29:1.3	There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta:	mn29	1	3	mn	29	The Longer Simile of the Heartwood
mn29:2.1	“Mendicants, take the case of a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking,	mn29	2	1	mn	29	The Longer Simile of the Heartwood

mn29:2.9	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood.

mn30:12.20	And what are those things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision?	mn30	12	20	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:13.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn30	13	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood

mn30:14.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	14	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:15.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn30	15	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:15.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	15	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:16.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn30	16	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:16.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	16	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:17.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	mn30	17	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:17.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	17	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood

mn30:19.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	19	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:20.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn30	20	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:20.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	20	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:21.1	Furthermore, take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.	mn30	21	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:21.2	This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	21	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:21.3	These are the things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision.	mn30	21	3	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:22.1	Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. He’d cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood.	mn30	22	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:22.2	Whatever he needs to make from heartwood, he will succeed.	mn30	22	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:22.3	That’s what this person is like, I say.	mn30	22	3	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:23.1	And so, brahmin, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions, honor, and popularity, or for accomplishment in ethics, or for accomplishment in immersion, or for knowledge and vision.	mn30	23	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:23.2	Rather, the goal, heartwood, and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heart.”	mn30	23	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:24.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha said to the Buddha,	mn30	24	1	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:24.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! …	mn30	24	2	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn30:24.3	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn30	24	3	mn	30	The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
mn31:1.1	So I have heard.	mn31	1	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.	mn31	1	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:2.1	Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.	mn31	2	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that park.	mn31	3	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.2	The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	mn31	3	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.3	and said to him,	mn31	3	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.4	“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.	mn31	3	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.5	There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire self-knowledge.	mn31	3	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:3.6	Do not disturb them.”	mn31	3	6	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.1	Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,	mn31	4	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.2	and said to him,	mn31	4	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.3	“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!	mn31	4	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.4	Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”	mn31	4	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.5	Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,	mn31	4	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:4.6	“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”	mn31	4	6	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.1	Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.	mn31	5	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.2	One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.	mn31	5	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.3	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	mn31	5	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.4	and washed his feet.	mn31	5	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.5	Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.	mn31	5	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.6	The Buddha said to Anuruddha,	mn31	5	6	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.7	“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn31	5	7	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:5.8	“We’re keeping well, Blessed One, we’re getting by. And we have no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn31	5	8	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:6.1	“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”	mn31	6	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:6.2	“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony like this.”	mn31	6	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:6.3	“But how do you live this way?”	mn31	6	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.1	“In this case, sir, I think,	mn31	7	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.2	‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn31	7	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.3	to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’	mn31	7	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.4	I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.	mn31	7	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.7	I think,	mn31	7	7	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.8	‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’	mn31	7	8	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.9	And that’s what I do.	mn31	7	9	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.10	Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”	mn31	7	10	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.11	And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:	mn31	7	11	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:7.23	“That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”	mn31	7	23	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:8.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	mn31	8	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:8.2	But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”	mn31	8	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.1	“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”	mn31	9	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.2	“But how do you live this way?”	mn31	9	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.3	“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.	mn31	9	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.4	If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.	mn31	9	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.5	Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.	mn31	9	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.6	If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.	mn31	9	6	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.7	If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.	mn31	9	7	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.8	And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.	mn31	9	8	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:9.9	That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”	mn31	9	9	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:10.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	mn31	10	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:10.2	But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation?”	mn31	10	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:10.3	“How could we not, sir?	mn31	10	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:10.4	Whenever we want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, we enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn31	10	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:10.5	This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved while living diligent, keen, and resolute.”	mn31	10	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:11-13.1	“Good, good!	mn31	11-13	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga

mn31:20.4	“The venerables did not tell me that they had	mn31	20	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:20.5	gained such meditations and attainments. But I discovered it by comprehending your minds,	mn31	20	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:20.7	and deities also told me.	mn31	20	7	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:20.9	I answered when the Buddha directly asked about it.”	mn31	20	9	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.1	Then the native spirit Dīgha Parajana went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	mn31	21	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.2	“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky	mn31	21	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.3	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,	mn31	21	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.4	the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”	mn31	21	4	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.5	Hearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana, the earth gods raised the cry …	mn31	21	5	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.9	Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings …	mn31	21	9	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.10	the gods of the thirty-three …	mn31	21	10	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.11	the gods of Yama …	mn31	21	11	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.12	the joyful gods …	mn31	21	12	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.13	the gods who love to imagine …	mn31	21	13	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.14	the gods who control what is imagined by others …	mn31	21	14	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.15	the gods of the Divinity’s host raised the cry,	mn31	21	15	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.16	“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky	mn31	21	16	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.17	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,	mn31	21	17	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.18	the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”	mn31	21	18	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:21.19	And so at that moment, that second, that hour, those venerables were known as far as the realm of divinity.	mn31	21	19	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.1	“That’s so true, Dīgha! That’s so true!	mn31	22	1	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.2	If the family from which those three gentlemen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for that family’s lasting welfare and happiness.	mn31	22	2	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.3	If the family circle …	mn31	22	3	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga

mn31:22.11	all the workers were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for all those menials’ lasting welfare and happiness.	mn31	22	11	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.12	If the whole world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for the whole world’s lasting welfare and happiness.	mn31	22	12	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.13	See, Dīgha, how those three gentlemen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!”	mn31	22	13	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.14	That is what the Buddha said.	mn31	22	14	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn31:22.15	Satisfied, the native spirit Dīgha Parajana approved what the Buddha said.	mn31	22	15	mn	31	The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:1.1	So I have heard.	mn32	1	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as	mn32	1	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:1.3	the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.	mn32	1	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and said,	mn32	2	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:2.2	“Come, Reverend Kassapa, let’s go to Venerable Sāriputta to hear the teaching.”	mn32	2	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:2.3	“Yes, reverend,” Mahākassapa replied.	mn32	2	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:2.4	Then, together with Venerable Anuruddha, they went to Sāriputta to hear the teaching.	mn32	2	4	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:3.1	Seeing them, Venerable Ānanda	mn32	3	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:3.2	went to Venerable Revata, told him what was happening,	mn32	3	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:3.3	and invited him also.	mn32	3	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.1	Sāriputta saw them coming off in the distance	mn32	4	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.2	and said to Ānanda,	mn32	4	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.3	“Come, Venerable Ānanda.	mn32	4	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.4	Welcome to Ānanda, the Buddha’s attendant, who is so close to the Buddha.	mn32	4	4	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.5	Ānanda, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.	mn32	4	5	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.6	What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?”	mn32	4	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.7	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	mn32	4	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.8	And they teach the four assemblies in order to uproot the underlying tendencies with well-rounded and coherent words and phrases.	mn32	4	8	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:4.9	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	4	9	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:5.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Revata,	mn32	5	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:5.2	“Reverend Revata, Ānanda has answered by speaking from his heart.	mn32	5	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:5.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	mn32	5	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:5.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who enjoys retreat and loves retreat. They’re committed to inner serenity of the heart, they don’t neglect absorption, they’re endowed with discernment, and they frequent empty huts.	mn32	5	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:5.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	5	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Anuruddha,	mn32	6	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.2	“Reverend Anuruddha, Revata has answered by speaking from his heart.	mn32	6	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	mn32	6	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who surveys a thousandfold galaxy with clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human,	mn32	6	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.7	just as a person with clear eyes could survey a thousand orbits from the upper floor of a royal longhouse.	mn32	6	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:6.9	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	6	9	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:7.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahākassapa,	mn32	7	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:7.2	“Reverend Kassapa, Anuruddha has answered by speaking from his heart.	mn32	7	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:7.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	mn32	7	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:7.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who lives in the wilderness, eats only almsfood, wears rag robes, and owns just three robes; and they praise these things. They are of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praise these things. They are accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom; and they praise these things.	mn32	7	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:7.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	7	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:8.1	When he had spoken, Sāriputta said to Mahāmoggallāna,	mn32	8	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:8.2	“Reverend Moggallāna, Mahākassapa has answered by speaking from his heart.	mn32	8	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:8.3	And now we ask you the same question.”	mn32	8	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:8.6	“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching. They question each other and answer each other’s questions without faltering, and their discussion on the teaching flows on.	mn32	8	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:8.7	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	8	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna said to Sāriputta,	mn32	9	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.2	“Each of us has spoken from our heart.	mn32	9	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.3	And now we ask you:	mn32	9	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.4	Sāriputta, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.	mn32	9	4	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.5	What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?”	mn32	9	5	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.6	“Reverend Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it.	mn32	9	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.7	In the morning, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.	mn32	9	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.8	At midday,	mn32	9	8	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.9	and in the evening, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.	mn32	9	9	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.10	Suppose that a ruler or their chief minister had a chest full of garments of different colors.	mn32	9	10	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.11	In the morning, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted.	mn32	9	11	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.12	At midday,	mn32	9	12	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.13	and in the evening, they’d don whatever pair of garments they wanted.	mn32	9	13	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.14	In the same way, a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it.	mn32	9	14	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.15	In the morning, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.	mn32	9	15	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.16	At midday,	mn32	9	16	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.17	and in the evening, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want.	mn32	9	17	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:9.18	That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.”	mn32	9	18	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.1	Then Sāriputta said to those venerables,	mn32	10	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.2	“Each of us has spoken from the heart.	mn32	10	2	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.3	Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this.	mn32	10	3	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.4	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	mn32	10	4	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.5	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn32	10	5	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:10.6	Then those venerables went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Venerable Sāriputta told the Buddha of how the mendicants had come to see him, and how he had asked Ānanda:	mn32	10	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.6	“‘Ānanda, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and heavenly scents seem to float on the air.	mn32	11	6	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.7	What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?’	mn32	11	7	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.8	When I had spoken, Ānanda said to me:	mn32	11	8	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.9	‘Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who is very learned …	mn32	11	9	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga

mn32:11.12	“Good, good, Sāriputta!	mn32	11	12	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.13	Ānanda answered in the right way for him.	mn32	11	13	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:11.14	For Ānanda is very learned …”	mn32	11	14	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
mn32:12.1	“Next I asked Revata the same question.	mn32	12	1	mn	32	The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga

mn34:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn34	1	5	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn34	1	6	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:2.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an unintelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, without inspecting the near shore or the far shore, he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.	mn34	2	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:3.1	But the cattle bunched up in mid-stream and came to ruin right there.	mn34	3	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:3.2	Why is that?	mn34	3	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:3.3	Because the unintelligent cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no ford.	mn34	3	3	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:3.4	In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and unskilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite. If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting, it will be for their lasting harm and suffering.	mn34	3	4	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:4.1	Once upon a time, mendicants, there was an intelligent Magadhan cowherd. In the last month of the rainy season, in autumn, after inspecting the near shore and the far shore, he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the northern shore among the Suvidehans.	mn34	4	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.1	First he drove across the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd.	mn34	5	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.2	They breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.	mn34	5	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.3	Then he drove across the strong and tractable cattle.	mn34	5	3	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.4	They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.	mn34	5	4	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.5	Then he drove across the bullocks and heifers.	mn34	5	5	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.6	They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.	mn34	5	6	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

mn34:5.8	They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore.	mn34	5	8	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.9	Once it happened that a baby calf had just been born. Urged on by its mother’s lowing, even it managed to breast the stream of the Ganges and safely reach the far shore.	mn34	5	9	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:5.10	Why is that?	mn34	5	10	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

mn34:5.12	In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite.

mn34:6.1	Just like the bulls, fathers and leaders of the herd, who crossed the Ganges to safety	mn34	6	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

Having breasted Māra’s stream, they have safely crossed over to the far shore.	mn34	6	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:7.1	Just like the strong and tractable cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety	mn34	7	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:7.2	are the mendicants who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.	mn34	7	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:8.1	Just like the bullocks and heifers who crossed the Ganges to safety	mn34	8	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:8.2	are the mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.	mn34	8	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:9.1	Just like the calves and weak cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety	mn34	9	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:9.2	are the mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore.	mn34	9	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:10.1	Just like the baby calf who had just been born, but, urged on by its mother’s lowing, still managed to cross the Ganges to safety	mn34	10	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

mn34:11.1	Mendicants, I am skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Māra’s dominion and its opposite, and skilled in Death’s dominion and its opposite.

mn34:12.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn34	12	1	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	mn34	12	2	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd

mn34:12.9	has opened the door to freedom from death,	mn34	12	9	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.10	for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment.	mn34	12	10	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.11	The Wicked One’s stream has been cut,	mn34	12	11	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.12	it’s blown away and mown down.	mn34	12	12	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.13	Be full of joy, mendicants,	mn34	12	13	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn34:12.14	set your heart on sanctuary!”	mn34	12	14	mn	34	The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
mn35:1.1	So I have heard.	mn35	1	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	mn35	1	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:2.1	Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people.	mn35	2	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:2.2	He was telling a crowd in Vesālī,	mn35	2	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:2.3	“I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn35	2	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:2.4	Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate.	mn35	2	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:2.5	How much more then a human being!”	mn35	2	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:3.1	Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	mn35	3	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:3.2	As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance.	mn35	3	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:3.3	He approached him and exchanged greetings with him.	mn35	3	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:3.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji,	mn35	3	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.1	“Worthy Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”	mn35	4	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.2	“Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and his instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:	mn35	4	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.3	‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	mn35	4	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.4	Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	mn35	4	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.5	All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’	mn35	4	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.6	This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”	mn35	4	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.7	“It’s sad to hear, worthy Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine.	mn35	4	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:4.8	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception.”	mn35	4	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.1	Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall on some business.	mn35	5	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.2	Then Saccaka went up to them and said,	mn35	5	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.3	“Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.	mn35	5	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.4	If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a mendicant named Assaji—I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!	mn35	5	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.6	Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!	mn35	5	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.8	Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about, and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!	mn35	5	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.10	I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!	mn35	5	10	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:5.12	Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.”	mn35	5	12	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:6.1	At that, some of the Licchavis said,	mn35	6	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:6.2	“How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?”	mn35	6	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:6.3	But some of the Licchavis said,	mn35	6	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:6.4	“Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddha’s doctrine, when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?”	mn35	6	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:6.5	Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.	mn35	6	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:7.1	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	mn35	7	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:7.2	Then Saccaka went up to them and said,	mn35	7	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:7.3	“Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?	mn35	7	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:7.4	For we want to see him.”	mn35	7	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:7.5	“Aggivessana, the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.”	mn35	7	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:8.1	Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn35	8	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:8.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	mn35	8	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:8.3	Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	mn35	8	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.1	Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,	mn35	9	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.2	“I’d like to ask the worthy Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	mn35	9	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.3	“Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.”	mn35	9	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.4	“How does the worthy Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”	mn35	9	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.5	“This is how I guide my disciples, and my instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:	mn35	9	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.6	‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.	mn35	9	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.7	Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.	mn35	9	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.8	All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’	mn35	9	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:9.9	This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds.”	mn35	9	9	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:10.1	“A simile strikes me, worthy Gotama.”	mn35	10	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:10.2	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	mn35	10	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:10.3	“All the plants and seeds that achieve growth, increase, and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth.	mn35	10	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:10.5	All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth.	mn35	10	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:10.7	In the same way, an individual’s self is form. Grounded on form they create merit and wickedness. An individual’s self is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness. Grounded on consciousness they create merit and wickedness.”	mn35	10	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.1	“Aggivessana, are you not saying this:	mn35	11	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.2	‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’?”	mn35	11	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.3	“Indeed, worthy Gotama, that is what I am saying.	mn35	11	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.4	And this big crowd agrees with me!”	mn35	11	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.5	“What has this big crowd to do with you?	mn35	11	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.6	Please just unpack your own statement.”	mn35	11	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.7	“Then, worthy Gotama, what I am saying is this:	mn35	11	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:11.8	‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’.”	mn35	11	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.1	“Well then, Aggivessana, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn35	12	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.2	What do you think, Aggivessana?	mn35	12	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.3	Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha.	mn35	12	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.4	Would they have the power in their own realm to execute those who have incurred execution, fine those who have incurred fines, or banish those who have incurred banishment?”	mn35	12	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.5	“An anointed king would have such power, worthy Gotama.	mn35	12	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.7	Even federations such as the	mn35	12	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.8	Vajjis and Mallas	mn35	12	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.9	have such power in their own realm.	mn35	12	9	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.11	So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu	mn35	12	11	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:12.12	would wield such power, as is their right.”	mn35	12	12	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.1	“What do you think, Aggivessana?	mn35	13	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.2	When you say,	mn35	13	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.3	‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say:	mn35	13	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.4	‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”	mn35	13	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.5	When he said this, Saccaka kept silent.	mn35	13	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.6	The Buddha asked the question a second time,	mn35	13	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.10	but Saccaka still kept silent.	mn35	13	10	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.11	So the Buddha said to Saccaka,	mn35	13	11	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.12	“Answer now, Aggivessana. Now is not the time for silence.	mn35	13	12	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:13.13	If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”	mn35	13	13	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:14.1	Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇī, taking up a burning iron thunderbolt, blazing and glowing, stood in the air above Saccaka, thinking,	mn35	14	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:14.2	“If this Saccaka doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!”	mn35	14	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:14.3	And both the Buddha and Saccaka could see Vajirapāṇī.	mn35	14	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:14.4	Saccaka was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he said,	mn35	14	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:14.5	“Ask me, worthy Gotama. I will answer.”	mn35	14	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:15.1	“What do you think, Aggivessana?	mn35	15	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:15.2	When you say,	mn35	15	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:15.3	‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say:	mn35	15	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:15.4	‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”	mn35	15	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:15.5	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn35	15	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:16.1	“Think about it, Aggivessana!	mn35	16	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:16.2	You should think before answering.	mn35	16	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka

mn35:22.6	But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī:	mn35	22	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.7	‘I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn35	22	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.8	Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate.	mn35	22	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.9	How much more then a human being!’	mn35	22	9	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.10	But sweat is pouring from your forehead; it’s soaked through your robe and drips on the ground.	mn35	22	10	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.11	While I now have no sweat on my body.”	mn35	22	11	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.12	So the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assembly.	mn35	22	12	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:22.13	When this was said, Saccaka sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	mn35	22	13	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.1	Knowing this, the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Buddha,	mn35	23	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.2	“A simile strikes me, Blessed One.”	mn35	23	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	mn35	23	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.4	“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village,	mn35	23	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.5	and a crab lived there.	mn35	23	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.6	Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.	mn35	23	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.7	Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.	mn35	23	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.8	And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond.	mn35	23	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.9	In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all Saccaka’s twists, ducks, and dodges.	mn35	23	9	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:23.10	Now he can’t get near the Buddha again looking for a debate.”	mn35	23	10	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.1	But Saccaka said to him,	mn35	24	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.2	“Hold on, Dummukha, hold on! I wasn’t talking with you, I was talking with the worthy Gotama.	mn35	24	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.3	Worthy Gotama, leave aside that statement I made—as did various other ascetics and brahmins—	mn35	24	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.4	it was, like, just a bit of nonsense.	mn35	24	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.5	How do you define a disciple of the worthy Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions?”	mn35	24	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.6	“It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn35	24	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.7	They truly see any kind of feeling …	mn35	24	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.8	perception …	mn35	24	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.9	choices …	mn35	24	9	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.10	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’	mn35	24	10	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:24.11	That’s how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.”	mn35	24	11	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.1	“But how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment?”	mn35	25	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.2	“It’s when a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping.	mn35	25	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.3	They truly see any kind of feeling …	mn35	25	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.4	perception …	mn35	25	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.5	choices …	mn35	25	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.6	consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping.	mn35	25	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:25.7	That’s how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.	mn35	25	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:26.1	A mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualities:	mn35	26	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:26.2	unsurpassable seeing, practice, and freedom.	mn35	26	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:26.3	They honor, respect, esteem, and venerate only the Realized One:	mn35	26	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:26.4	‘The Blessed One is awakened, tamed, serene, crossed over, and quenched. And he teaches Dhamma for awakening, self-control, serenity, crossing over, and extinguishment.’”	mn35	26	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.1	When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him,	mn35	27	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.2	“Worthy Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.	mn35	27	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.3	For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	mn35	27	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.4	A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	mn35	27	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.5	They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama.	mn35	27	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.6	It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.	mn35	27	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.7	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	mn35	27	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:27.8	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn35	27	8	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:28.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Saccaka addressed those Licchavis,	mn35	28	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:28.2	“Listen, gentlemen. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrow’s meal.	mn35	28	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:28.3	You may all bring me what you think is suitable.”	mn35	28	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:29.1	Then, when the night had passed, those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food.	mn35	29	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:29.2	And Saccaka had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own park. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	mn35	29	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:29.3	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	mn35	29	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Saccaka’s park, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn35	30	1	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.2	Then Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn35	30	2	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn35	30	3	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.4	Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,	mn35	30	4	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.5	“Worthy Gotama, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors.”	mn35	30	5	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.6	“Aggivessana, whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourself—who is not free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to the donors.	mn35	30	6	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn35:30.7	Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myself—who is free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to you.”	mn35	30	7	mn	35	The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:1.1	So I have heard.	mn36	1	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	mn36	1	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:2.1	Now at that time in the morning the Buddha, being properly dressed, took his bowl and robe, wishing to enter Vesālī for alms.	mn36	2	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.1	Then as Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.	mn36	3	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.2	Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance,	mn36	3	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.3	and said to the Buddha,	mn36	3	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.4	“Sir, Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, is coming. He’s a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people.	mn36	3	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.5	He wants to discredit the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	mn36	3	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.6	Please, sir, sit for an hour out of sympathy.”	mn36	3	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.	mn36	3	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:3.8	Then Saccaka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	mn36	3	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance, without developing the mind.	mn36	4	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.2	They suffer painful physical feelings.	mn36	4	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.3	This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.	mn36	4	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.4	Their mind was subject to the body, and the body had power over it.	mn36	4	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.5	Why is that?	mn36	4	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.6	Because their mind was not developed.	mn36	4	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.7	There are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.	mn36	4	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.8	They suffer painful mental feelings.	mn36	4	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.9	This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind.	mn36	4	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.10	Their body was subject to the mind, and the mind had power over it.	mn36	4	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.11	Why is that?	mn36	4	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.12	Because their physical endurance was not developed.	mn36	4	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.13	It occurs to me that	mn36	4	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:4.14	The worthy Gotama’s disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.”	mn36	4	14	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.1	“But Aggivessana, what have you heard about the development of physical endurance?”	mn36	5	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.2	“Take, for example,	mn36	5	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.3	Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.	mn36	5	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.4	They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	mn36	5	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.5	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	mn36	5	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.6	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	mn36	5	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.7	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	mn36	5	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:5.8	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.”	mn36	5	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.1	“But Aggivessana, do they get by on so little?”	mn36	6	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.2	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn36	6	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.3	Sometimes they eat luxury fresh and cooked foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages.	mn36	6	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.4	They gather their body’s strength, build it up, and get fat.”	mn36	6	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.5	“What they earlier gave up, they later got back. That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body.	mn36	6	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.6	But Aggivessana, what have you heard about development of the mind?”	mn36	6	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:6.7	When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind, he was stumped.	mn36	6	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.1	So the Buddha said to Saccaka,	mn36	7	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.2	“The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble one’s training.	mn36	7	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.3	And since you don’t even understand the development of physical endurance, how can you possibly understand the development of the mind?	mn36	7	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.4	Still, as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind, and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind,	mn36	7	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.5	listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn36	7	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka.	mn36	7	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:7.7	The Buddha said this:	mn36	7	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.1	“And how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mind?	mn36	8	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.2	Take an unlearned ordinary person who has a pleasant feeling.	mn36	8	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.3	When they experience a pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it.	mn36	8	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.4	Then that pleasant feeling ceases.	mn36	8	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.5	And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises.	mn36	8	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.6	When they suffer painful feeling, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn36	8	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.7	Because their physical endurance is undeveloped, pleasant feelings occupy the mind. And because their mind is undeveloped, painful feelings occupy the mind.	mn36	8	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:8.8	Anyone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped both in physical endurance and in mind.	mn36	8	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.1	And how is someone developed in physical endurance and mind?	mn36	9	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.2	Take a learned noble disciple who has a pleasant feeling.	mn36	9	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.3	When they experience a pleasant feeling they don’t become full of lust for it.	mn36	9	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.4	Then that pleasant feeling ceases.	mn36	9	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.5	And when it ceases, painful feeling arises.	mn36	9	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.6	When they suffer painful feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn36	9	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.7	Because their physical endurance is developed, pleasant feelings don’t occupy the mind. And because their mind is developed, painful feelings don’t occupy the mind.	mn36	9	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:9.8	Anyone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed both in physical endurance and in mind.”	mn36	9	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:10.1	“I am quite confident that the worthy Gotama	mn36	10	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:10.2	is developed in physical endurance and in mind.”	mn36	10	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:10.3	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Aggivessana.	mn36	10	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:10.4	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	mn36	10	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:10.5	Ever since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mind.”	mn36	10	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:11.1	“Worthy Gotama mustn’t have experienced the kind of pleasant or painful feelings that would occupy the mind.”	mn36	11	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:12.1	“How could I not, Aggivessana?	mn36	12	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:12.2	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:	mn36	12	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:12.3	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	mn36	12	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:12.4	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn36	12	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:12.5	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn36	12	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn36	13	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.2	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn36	13	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.3	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn36	13	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.4	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	mn36	13	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.5	‘Stay, venerable.	mn36	13	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.6	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn36	13	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.7	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn36	13	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.8	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn36	13	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.9	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	13	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.10	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn36	13	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.11	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn36	13	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn36	13	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	mn36	13	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.14	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	mn36	13	14	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.15	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	13	15	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.16	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	mn36	13	16	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.17	energy,	mn36	13	17	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.18	mindfulness,	mn36	13	18	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.19	immersion,	mn36	13	19	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.20	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn36	13	20	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.21	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	mn36	13	21	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:13.22	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn36	13	22	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn36	14	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	mn36	14	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.3	‘I have, reverend.’	mn36	14	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.4	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn36	14	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.5	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn36	14	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.6	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn36	14	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.7	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn36	14	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.8	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	mn36	14	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.9	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	mn36	14	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.10	I am like you and you are like me.	mn36	14	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.11	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	mn36	14	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.12	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	mn36	14	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.13	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	14	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.14	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	mn36	14	14	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:14.15	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn36	14	15	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn36	15	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn36	15	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.3	Uddaka replied,	mn36	15	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.4	‘Stay, venerable.	mn36	15	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn36	15	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn36	15	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn36	15	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.8	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	15	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn36	15	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn36	15	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.11	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn36	15	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	mn36	15	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn36	15	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.14	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	15	14	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	mn36	15	15	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.16	energy,	mn36	15	16	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.17	mindfulness,	mn36	15	17	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka

mn36:15.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn36	15	21	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.22	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn36	15	22	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.23	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	mn36	15	23	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.24	‘He had, reverend.’	mn36	15	24	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.25	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn36	15	25	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.26	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn36	15	26	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.27	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn36	15	27	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.28	The teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you have realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it. The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	mn36	15	28	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.29	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	mn36	15	29	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.30	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	mn36	15	30	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.31	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	mn36	15	31	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.32	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	mn36	15	32	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.33	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	15	33	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.34	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	mn36	15	34	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:15.35	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn36	15	35	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	mn36	16	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	mn36	16	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.3	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	16	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	mn36	16	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	mn36	16	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.6	So I sat down right there, thinking:	mn36	16	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:16.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	mn36	16	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	mn36	17	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	mn36	17	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn36	17	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn36	17	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.5	What do you think, Aggivessana?	mn36	17	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in the water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn36	17	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn36	17	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.8	Why not?	mn36	17	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.9	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	mn36	17	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn36	17	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	mn36	17	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:17.13	This was the first example that occurred to me.	mn36	17	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	mn36	18	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn36	18	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn36	18	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn36	18	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.5	What do you think, Aggivessana?	mn36	18	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn36	18	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn36	18	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.8	Why not?	mn36	18	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	mn36	18	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn36	18	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:18.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

mn36:18.12	This was the second example that occurred to me.	mn36	18	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	mn36	19	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn36	19	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn36	19	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn36	19	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka

mn36:19.7	“Yes, worthy Gotama.	mn36	19	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.8	Why is that?	mn36	19	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	mn36	19	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:19.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

mn36:19.12	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	mn36	19	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	20	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	mn36	20	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.3	So that’s what I did,	mn36	20	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn36	20	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	mn36	20	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn36	20	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	20	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:20.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	20	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	21	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	mn36	21	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn36	21	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	mn36	21	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	mn36	21	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	21	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:21.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	21	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	22	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn36	22	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn36	22	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.4	But then strong winds ground my head,	mn36	22	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.5	like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.	mn36	22	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	22	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:22.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	22	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	23	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn36	23	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn36	23	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.4	But then I got a severe headache,	mn36	23	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.5	like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	mn36	23	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	23	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:23.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	23	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	24	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn36	24	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn36	24	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.4	But then strong winds carved up my belly,	mn36	24	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.5	like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn36	24	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	24	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:24.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	24	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	25	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn36	25	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn36	25	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.4	But then there was an intense burning in my body,	mn36	25	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.5	like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	mn36	25	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn36	25	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:25.8	But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	25	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.1	Then some deities saw me and said,	mn36	26	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	mn36	26	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.3	Others said,	mn36	26	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	mn36	26	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.5	Others said,	mn36	26	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:26.6	‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’	mn36	26	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	27	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.2	‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’	mn36	27	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.3	But deities came to me and said,	mn36	27	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	mn36	27	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	mn36	27	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.6	Then I thought,	mn36	27	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.7	‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’	mn36	27	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:27.8	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	mn36	27	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	28	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	mn36	28	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.3	So that’s what I did,	mn36	28	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	mn36	28	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	mn36	28	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	mn36	28	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	mn36	28	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	mn36	28	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	mn36	28	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	mn36	28	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	mn36	28	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	mn36	28	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:28.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	mn36	28	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:29.1	Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	mn36	29	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:29.2	Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	mn36	29	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:29.3	Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	mn36	29	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:29.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	mn36	29	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:30.1	Then I thought,	mn36	30	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:30.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	mn36	30	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:30.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work.	mn36	30	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:30.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	mn36	30	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:31.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	31	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:31.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn36	31	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:31.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	mn36	31	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:31.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	mn36	31	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:31.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	mn36	31	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:32.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn36	32	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:32.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	mn36	32	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:32.3	Then I thought,	mn36	32	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:32.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	mn36	32	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.1	Then I thought,	mn36	33	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	mn36	33	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.3	So I ate some solid food.	mn36	33	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.4	Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	mn36	33	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.5	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	mn36	33	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.6	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	mn36	33	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:33.7	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	mn36	33	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:34.1	After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn36	34	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:34.2	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	34	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn36	35-37	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.2	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	35-37	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.3	And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn36	35-37	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.4	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	35-37	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.5	With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn36	35-37	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:35-37.6	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	35-37	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:38.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	mn36	38	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:38.2	I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn36	38	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:39.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	mn36	39	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:39.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn36	39	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:39.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	39	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:40.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn36	40	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:40.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn36	40	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:41.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	mn36	41	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:41.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn36	41	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:41.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	41	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:42.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn36	42	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:42.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	mn36	42	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:42.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’	mn36	42	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:43.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn36	43	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:43.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	mn36	43	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:43.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	mn36	43	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:44.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	mn36	44	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:44.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn36	44	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:44.3	But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind.	mn36	44	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.1	Aggivessana, I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds,	mn36	45	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.2	and each person thought	mn36	45	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.3	that I was teaching the Dhamma especially for them.	mn36	45	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.4	But it should not be seen like this.	mn36	45	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.5	The Realized One teaches others only so that they can understand.	mn36	45	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.6	When that talk was finished, I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind in samādhi internally, using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that I used before, which I regularly use to meditate.”	mn36	45	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.7	“I’d believe that of the worthy Gotama, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn36	45	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:45.8	But do you ever recall sleeping during the day?”	mn36	45	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.1	“I do recall that in the last month of the summer, I have spread out my outer robe folded in four and lain down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.”	mn36	46	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.2	“Some ascetics and brahmins call that a deluded abiding.”	mn36	46	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.3	“That’s not how to define whether someone is deluded or not.	mn36	46	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.4	But as to how to define whether someone is deluded or not,	mn36	46	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.5	listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn36	46	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka.	mn36	46	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:46.7	The Buddha said this:	mn36	46	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.1	“Anyone who has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death is deluded, I say.	mn36	47	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.2	For it’s not giving up the defilements that makes you deluded.	mn36	47	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.3	Anyone who has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death—is not deluded, I say.	mn36	47	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.4	For it’s giving up the defilements that makes you not deluded.	mn36	47	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.5	The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	mn36	47	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.6	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	mn36	47	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:47.7	in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.”	mn36	47	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.1	When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him,	mn36	48	1	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.2	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	mn36	48	2	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.3	How when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha!	mn36	48	3	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.4	I recall taking on Pūraṇa Kassapa in debate.	mn36	48	4	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.5	He dodged the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	mn36	48	5	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.6	But when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn36	48	6	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.7	I recall taking on the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla,	mn36	48	7	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.8	Ajita of the hair blanket,	mn36	48	8	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.9	Pakudha Kaccāyana,	mn36	48	9	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.10	Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,	mn36	48	10	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.11	and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan in debate.	mn36	48	11	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.12	They all dodged the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	mn36	48	12	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.13	But when the worthy Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism, the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear, just like a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn36	48	13	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.14	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go.	mn36	48	14	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.15	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn36	48	15	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.16	“Please, Aggivessana, go at your convenience.”	mn36	48	16	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn36:48.17	Then Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.	mn36	48	17	mn	36	The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
mn37:1.1	So I have heard.	mn37	1	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	mn37	1	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:2.1	And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	mn37	2	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:2.2	“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”	mn37	2	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.1	“lord of gods, take a mendicant who has heard:	mn37	3	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.2	‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’	mn37	3	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.3	When a mendicant has heard that	mn37	3	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.4	nothing is worth insisting on,	mn37	3	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.5	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—	mn37	3	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.6	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.	mn37	3	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.7	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	mn37	3	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.8	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	mn37	3	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.9	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn37	3	9	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:3.10	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”	mn37	3	10	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:4.1	Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	mn37	4	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:5.1	Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha.	mn37	5	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:5.2	He thought,	mn37	5	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:5.3	“Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?	mn37	5	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:5.4	Why don’t I find out?”	mn37	5	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:6.1	And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.	mn37	6	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.1	Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a heavenly orchestra.	mn37	7	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.2	Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance,	mn37	7	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.3	he dismissed the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and said,	mn37	7	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.4	“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good fellow!	mn37	7	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn37	7	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.6	Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”	mn37	7	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.7	Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out,	mn37	7	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.8	while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn37	7	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:7.9	Mahāmoggallāna said to him,	mn37	7	9	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.1	“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?	mn37	8	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.2	Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”	mn37	8	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.3	“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do,	mn37	8	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.4	not only for myself, but also for the gods of the thirty-three.	mn37	8	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.5	Still, what is properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized does not vanish all of a sudden.	mn37	8	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.6	Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.	mn37	8	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.7	In that battle the gods won and the titans lost.	mn37	8	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.8	When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory.	mn37	8	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.9	The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers.	mn37	8	9	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.10	Each tower has seven hundred chambers.	mn37	8	10	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.11	Each chamber has seven nymphs.	mn37	8	11	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.12	Each nymph has seven maids.	mn37	8	12	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.13	Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?”	mn37	8	13	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:8.14	Mahāmoggallāna consented with silence.	mn37	8	14	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:9.1	Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.	mn37	9	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:9.2	When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids,	mn37	9	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:9.3	being discreet and prudent, each went to her own bedroom.	mn37	9	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.1	They were just like a daughter-in-law who is discreet and prudent when they see their father-in-law.	mn37	10	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.3	Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,	mn37	10	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.4	“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!	mn37	10	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.5	And that lovely thing!”	mn37	10	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.6	“That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.	mn37	10	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.7	Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:	mn37	10	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.8	‘It looks beautiful enough for the gods of the thirty-three!’	mn37	10	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:10.9	That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.”	mn37	10	9	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.1	Then Moggallāna thought,	mn37	11	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.2	“This spirit lives much too negligently.	mn37	11	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.3	Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”	mn37	11	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.4	Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.	mn37	11	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.5	Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the gods of the thirty-three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	mn37	11	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.6	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn37	11	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:11.7	The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”	mn37	11	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:12.1	Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,	mn37	12	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:12.2	“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?	mn37	12	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:12.3	Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”	mn37	12	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:12.4	“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	mn37	12	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:12.5	‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’	mn37	12	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.1	When I had spoken the Buddha said to me:	mn37	13	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.2	‘lord of gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:	mn37	13	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.3	“Nothing is worth insisting on”	mn37	13	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.4	When a mendicant has heard that	mn37	13	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.5	nothing is worth insisting on,	mn37	13	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.6	they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—	mn37	13	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.7	they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.	mn37	13	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.8	Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.	mn37	13	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.9	Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.	mn37	13	9	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.10	They understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”	mn37	13	10	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.11	That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’	mn37	13	11	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:13.12	That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.”	mn37	13	12	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.1	Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from among the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery.	mn37	14	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.2	Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him,	mn37	14	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.3	“Good fellow, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?”	mn37	14	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.4	“No, it was not.	mn37	14	4	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.5	That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”	mn37	14	5	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.6	“You’re fortunate, good fellow, so very fortunate,	mn37	14	6	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.7	to have a spiritual companion of such power and might!	mn37	14	7	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:14.8	We can’t believe that’s not the Blessed One, your Teacher!”	mn37	14	8	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.1	Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn37	15	1	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.2	“Sir, do you recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to a certain well-known and illustrious spirit?”	mn37	15	2	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.3	“I do, Moggallāna.” And the Buddha retold all that happened when Sakka came to visit him, adding:	mn37	15	3	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.17	“That’s how I recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to Sakka, lord of gods.”	mn37	15	17	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.18	That is what the Buddha said.	mn37	15	18	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn37:15.19	Satisfied, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approved what the Buddha said.	mn37	15	19	mn	37	The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:1.1	So I have heard.	mn38	1	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn38	1	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:2.1	Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception:	mn38	2	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:2.2	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	mn38	2	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.1	Several mendicants heard about this.	mn38	3	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.4	They went up to Sāti and said to him,	mn38	3	4	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.5	“Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:	mn38	3	5	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.6	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”	mn38	3	6	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.7	“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	mn38	3	7	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.8	Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,	mn38	3	8	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.9	“Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.	mn38	3	9	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.10	In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”	mn38	3	10	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:3.11	But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it.	mn38	3	11	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:4.1	When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	mn38	4	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	mn38	5	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that	mn38	5	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.3	the teacher summons him.”	mn38	5	3	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him,	mn38	5	4	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.5	“Reverend Sāti, the teacher summons you.”	mn38	5	5	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.6	“Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn38	5	6	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.7	“Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception:	mn38	5	7	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.8	‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”	mn38	5	8	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.9	“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”	mn38	5	9	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.10	“Sāti, what is that consciousness?”	mn38	5	10	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.11	“Sir, he is the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”	mn38	5	11	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.12	“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?	mn38	5	12	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.13	Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause?	mn38	5	13	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.14	But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and create much wickedness.	mn38	5	14	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:5.15	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	mn38	5	15	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn38	6	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	mn38	6	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.3	Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”	mn38	6	3	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.4	“How could that be, sir?	mn38	6	4	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.5	No, sir.”	mn38	6	5	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.6	When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	mn38	6	6	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.7	Knowing this, the Buddha said,	mn38	6	7	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.8	“Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.	mn38	6	8	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:6.9	I’ll question the mendicants about this.”	mn38	6	9	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn38	7	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.2	“Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness?”	mn38	7	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.3	“No, sir.	mn38	7	3	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.4	For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”	mn38	7	4	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.5	“Good, good, mendicants!	mn38	7	5	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.6	It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.	mn38	7	6	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.7	For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.	mn38	7	7	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.8	But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and creates much wickedness.	mn38	7	8	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:7.9	This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.	mn38	7	9	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.1	Consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises.	mn38	8	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.2	Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness.	mn38	8	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.3	Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness.	mn38	8	3	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.4	Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness.	mn38	8	4	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.5	Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness.	mn38	8	5	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.6	Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness.	mn38	8	6	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.7	Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and ideas is reckoned as mind consciousness.	mn38	8	7	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.8	It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it burns.	mn38	8	8	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.9	A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire.	mn38	8	9	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.10	A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire.	mn38	8	10	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.11	A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire.	mn38	8	11	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.12	A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire.	mn38	8	12	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.13	A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire.	mn38	8	13	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.14	A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire.	mn38	8	14	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:8.15	In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises. …	mn38	8	15	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:9.1	Mendicants, do you see that this has come to be?”	mn38	9	1	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:9.2	“Yes, sir.”	mn38	9	2	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
mn38:9.3	“Do you see that it originated with that as fuel?”	mn38	9	3	mn	38	The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving

mn39:2.3	Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.	mn39	2	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura

mn39:14.30	But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and a place of sanctuary at last.	mn39	14	30	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:15.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn39	15	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:15.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn39	15	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:15.3	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn39	15	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:15.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	mn39	15	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:15.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn39	15	5	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:16.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn39	16	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:16.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn39	16	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:16.3	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	mn39	16	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:16.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn39	16	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:17.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn39	17	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:17.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn39	17	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:17.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.	mn39	17	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:17.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn39	17	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:18.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn39	18	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:18.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	mn39	18	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:18.3	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.	mn39	18	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:18.4	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	mn39	18	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:19.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn39	19	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:19.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn39	19	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:19.3	Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’	mn39	19	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura

mn39:20.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn39	20	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:20.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn39	20	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:20.3	Suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.	mn39	20	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:20.4	In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn39	20	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn39	21	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	mn39	21	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’	mn39	21	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.4	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn39	21	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.5	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn39	21	5	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.6	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn39	21	6	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.7	Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.	mn39	21	7	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:21.9	They’d think:	mn39	21	9	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura

mn39:21.12	They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’	mn39	21	12	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:22.1	This mendicant is one who is called an ‘ascetic’, a ‘brahmin’, a ‘bathed initiate’, a ‘knowledge master’, a ‘scholar’, a ‘noble one’, and also a ‘perfected one’.	mn39	22	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:23.1	And how is a mendicant an ascetic?	mn39	23	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:23.2	They have assuaged the bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn39	23	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:23.3	That’s how a mendicant is an ascetic.	mn39	23	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:24.1	And how is a mendicant a brahmin?	mn39	24	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:24.2	They have banished the bad, unskillful qualities.	mn39	24	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:24.3	That’s how a mendicant is a brahmin.	mn39	24	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:25.1	And how is a mendicant a bathed initiate?	mn39	25	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:25.2	They have bathed off the bad, unskillful qualities.	mn39	25	2	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:25.3	That’s how a mendicant is a bathed initiate.	mn39	25	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:26.1	And how is a mendicant a knowledge master?	mn39	26	1	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura

mn39:29.3	That’s how a mendicant is a perfected one.”	mn39	29	3	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:29.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn39	29	4	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn39:29.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn39	29	5	mn	39	The Longer Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.1	So I have heard.	mn40	1	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura.	mn40	1	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn40	1	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn40	1	4	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn40	1	5	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn40	1	6	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:2.1	“Mendicants, people label you as ascetics.	mn40	2	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:2.2	And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics.	mn40	2	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:2.3	Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct.	mn40	2	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:2.6	Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’	mn40	2	6	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:3.1	And how does a mendicant not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic?	mn40	3	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:3.2	Any mendicant who has not given up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view	mn40	3	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:3.3	is not practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. And that is due to not giving up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic, these grounds for rebirth in places of loss, to be experienced in bad places.	mn40	3	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:4.1	I say that such a mendicant’s going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called ‘deadborn’—double-edged, whetted with yellow arsenic—that has been covered and wrapped in an outer robe.	mn40	4	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.1	I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘outer robe wearer’ just because you wear an outer robe.	mn40	5	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.2	You don’t deserve the label ‘naked ascetic’ just because you go naked.	mn40	5	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.3	You don’t deserve the label ‘dust and dirt wearer’ just because you’re caked in dust and dirt.	mn40	5	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura

mn40:5.6	You don’t deserve the label ‘open air dweller’ just because you stay in the open air.	mn40	5	6	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.7	You don’t deserve the label ‘stander’ just because you continually stand.	mn40	5	7	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.8	You don’t deserve the label ‘interval eater’ just because you eat food at set intervals.	mn40	5	8	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.9	You don’t deserve the label ‘reciter’ just because you recite hymns.	mn40	5	9	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:5.10	You don’t deserve the label ‘matted-hair ascetic’ just because you have matted hair.	mn40	5	10	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.1	Imagine that just by wearing an outer robe someone with covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view could give up these things. If that were the case, your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would make you an outer robe wearer as soon as you were born. They’d encourage you:	mn40	6	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.2	‘Please, dearest, wear an outer robe! By doing so you will give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view.’	mn40	6	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.3	But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is an outer robe wearer. That’s why I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘outer robe wearer’ just because you wear an outer robe.	mn40	6	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.4	Imagine that just by going naked …	mn40	6	4	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura

mn40:6.12	having matted hair someone with covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view could give up these things. If that were the case, your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would make you a matted-hair ascetic as soon as you were born. They’d encourage you:	mn40	6	12	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.13	‘Please, dearest, become a matted-hair ascetic! By doing so you will give up covetousness, ill will, irritability, hostility, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view.’	mn40	6	13	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:6.14	But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is a matted-hair ascetic. That’s why I say that you don’t deserve the label ‘matted-hair ascetic’ just because you have matted hair.	mn40	6	14	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:7.1	And how does a mendicant practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic?	mn40	7	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:7.2	Any mendicant who has given up covetousness, ill will, irritability, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deviousness, deceit, corrupt wishes, and wrong view	mn40	7	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:7.3	is practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic, I say. And that is due to giving up these stains, defects, and dregs of an ascetic, these grounds for rebirth in places of loss, to be experienced in bad places.	mn40	7	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:8.1	They see themselves purified from all these bad, unskillful qualities.	mn40	8	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:8.2	Seeing this, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn40	8	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:9.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn40	9	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:10-12.1	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn40	10-12	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura

mn40:13.1	Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.	mn40	13	1	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:13.2	Then along comes a person—whether from the east, west, north, or south—struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched.	mn40	13	2	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:13.3	No matter what direction they come from, when they arrive at that lotus pond they would alleviate their thirst and heat exhaustion.	mn40	13	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:13.4	In the same way, suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness—whether from a family of aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, or menials—and has arrived at the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. Having developed love, compassion, rejoicing, and equanimity in this way they gain inner peace.	mn40	13	4	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:13.5	Because of that inner peace they are practicing the way proper for an ascetic, I say.	mn40	13	5	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura

mn40:14.3	They’re an ascetic because of the ending of defilements.”	mn40	14	3	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:14.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn40	14	4	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn40:14.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn40	14	5	mn	40	The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
mn41:1.1	So I have heard.	mn41	1	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.	mn41	1	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard,	mn41	2	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn41	2	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn41	2	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn41	2	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn41	2	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.	mn41	2	6	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.7	He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life.	mn41	2	7	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:2.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn41	2	8	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha:	mn41	3	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:4.1	“What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?	mn41	4	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:4.2	And what is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”	mn41	4	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:5.1	“Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn41	5	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:5.2	Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”	mn41	5	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:6.1	“We don’t understand the detailed meaning of the worthy Gotama’s brief statement.	mn41	6	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:6.2	Worthy Gotama, please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning.”	mn41	6	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:6.3	“Well then, householders, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn41	6	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:6.4	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied.	mn41	6	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:6.5	The Buddha said this:	mn41	6	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:7.1	“Householders, unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.	mn41	7	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:8.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body?	mn41	8	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:8.2	It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	mn41	8	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:8.3	They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	mn41	8	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:8.4	They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.	mn41	8	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:8.5	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body.	mn41	8	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speech?	mn41	9	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.2	It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, worthy man, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.	mn41	9	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.3	They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.	mn41	9	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.4	They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.	mn41	9	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.5	They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.	mn41	9	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:9.6	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speech.	mn41	9	6	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.1	And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mind?	mn41	10	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.2	It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’	mn41	10	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.3	They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’	mn41	10	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.4	They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted:	mn41	10	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.5	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	mn41	10	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.6	This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of mind.	mn41	10	6	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:10.7	That’s how unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn41	10	7	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:11.1	Householders, principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind.	mn41	11	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:12.1	And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body?	mn41	12	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:12.2	It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	mn41	12	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:12.3	They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.	mn41	12	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:12.4	They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian.

mn41:13.1	And how is principled and moral conduct fourfold by way of speech?	mn41	13	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:13.2	It’s when a certain person gives up lying.

mn41:13.3	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	mn41	13	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:13.4	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people.	mn41	13	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:13.5	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	mn41	13	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:13.6	This is how principled and moral conduct is fourfold by way of speech.	mn41	13	6	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.1	And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of mind?	mn41	14	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.2	It’s when a certain person is not covetous. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’	mn41	14	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.3	They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‘May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!’	mn41	14	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.4	They have right view, an undistorted perspective:	mn41	14	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.5	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	mn41	14	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.6	This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of mind.	mn41	14	6	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:14.7	This is how principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	mn41	14	7	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:15.1	A person of principled and moral conduct might wish:	mn41	15	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:15.2	‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats!’	mn41	15	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:15.3	It’s possible that this might happen.	mn41	15	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:15.4	Why is that?	mn41	15	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:15.5	Because they have principled and moral conduct.	mn41	15	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā

mn41:43.5	Because they have principled and moral conduct.”	mn41	43	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:44.1	When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the Buddha,	mn41	44	1	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:44.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn41	44	2	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:44.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn41	44	3	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:44.4	We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn41	44	4	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn41:44.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”	mn41	44	5	mn	41	The People of Sālā
mn42:1.1	So I have heard.	mn42	1	1	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn42	1	2	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:2.1	Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Verañjā were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.	mn42	2	1	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:2.2	The brahmins and householders of Verañjā heard:	mn42	2	2	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:2.3	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn42	2	3	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:2.4	He has this good reputation …	mn42	2	4	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:2.8	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn42	2	8	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:3.1	… They said to the Buddha:	mn42	3	1	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:4.1	“What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?	mn42	4	1	mn	42	The People of Verañjā
mn42:4.2	And what is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”	mn42	4	2	mn	42	The People of Verañjā

mn43:1.1	So I have heard.	mn43	1	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn43	1	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn43	1	3	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:	mn43	1	4	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.1	“Reverend, they speak of ‘a witless person’.	mn43	2	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.2	How is a witless person defined?”	mn43	2	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.3	“Reverend, they’re called witless because they don’t understand.	mn43	2	3	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.4	And what don’t they understand?	mn43	2	4	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.5	They don’t understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	mn43	2	5	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.6	They’re called witless because they don’t understand.”	mn43	2	6	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:2.7	Saying “Good, reverend,” Mahākoṭṭhita approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then he asked another question:	mn43	2	7	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:3.1	“They speak of ‘a wise person’.	mn43	3	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:3.2	How is a wise person defined?”	mn43	3	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:3.3	“They’re called wise because they understand.	mn43	3	3	mn	43	The Great Elaboration

mn43:3.6	They’re called wise because they understand.”	mn43	3	6	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.1	“They speak of ‘consciousness’.	mn43	4	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.2	How is consciousness defined?”	mn43	4	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.3	“It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.	mn43	4	3	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.4	And what does it cognize?	mn43	4	4	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.5	It cognizes ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.	mn43	4	5	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:4.6	It’s called consciousness because it cognizes.”	mn43	4	6	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.1	“Wisdom and consciousness—	mn43	5	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.2	are these things mixed or separate?	mn43	5	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.3	And can we completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them?”	mn43	5	3	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.4	“Wisdom and consciousness—	mn43	5	4	mn	43	The Great Elaboration

mn43:5.6	And you can never completely disentangle them so as to describe the difference between them.	mn43	5	6	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.7	For you understand what you cognize, and you cognize what you understand.	mn43	5	7	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:5.8	That’s why these things are mixed, not separate.	mn43	5	8	mn	43	The Great Elaboration

mn43:6.2	what is the difference between these things that are mixed, not separate?”	mn43	6	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:6.4	“The difference between these things is that wisdom should be developed, while consciousness should be completely understood.”	mn43	6	4	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:7.1	“They speak of this thing called ‘feeling’.	mn43	7	1	mn	43	The Great Elaboration
mn43:7.2	How is feeling defined?”	mn43	7	2	mn	43	The Great Elaboration

mn45:1.1	So I have heard.	mn45	1	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn45	1	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn45	1	3	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn45	1	4	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn45	1	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn45	1	6	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these four ways of taking up practices.	mn45	2	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.2	What four?	mn45	2	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.3	There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.	mn45	2	3	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.4	There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.	mn45	2	4	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.5	There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.	mn45	2	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:2.6	There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.	mn45	2	6	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.1	And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain?	mn45	3	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.2	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn45	3	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.3	‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures.’	mn45	3	3	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.4	They throw themselves into sensual pleasures,	mn45	3	4	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.5	cavorting with female wanderers with jeweled bands in their hair.	mn45	3	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.6	They say,	mn45	3	6	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.7	‘What future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensual pleasures that they speak of giving up sensual pleasures, and advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures?	mn45	3	7	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.8	Pleasant is the touch of this female wanderer’s arm, tender, soft, and downy!’ And they throw themselves into sensual pleasures.	mn45	3	8	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.9	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn45	3	9	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.10	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.	mn45	3	10	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.11	They say,	mn45	3	11	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:3.12	‘This is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw. For it is because of sensual pleasures that I’m feeling painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.’	mn45	3	12	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.1	Suppose that in the last month of summer a camel’s foot creeper pod were to burst open	mn45	4	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.2	and a seed were to fall at the root of a sal tree.	mn45	4	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.3	Then the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervous.	mn45	4	3	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.4	But their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin—deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees—would come together to reassure them,	mn45	4	4	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.5	‘Do not fear, sir, do not fear!	mn45	4	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.6	Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.’	mn45	4	6	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.7	But none of these things happened. And the seed was fertile, so that when the monsoon clouds soaked it with rain, it sprouted.	mn45	4	7	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.8	And the creeper wound its tender, soft, and downy tendrils around that sal tree.	mn45	4	8	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.9	Then the deity thought,	mn45	4	9	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.10	‘What future danger did my friends see when they said:	mn45	4	10	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.11	“Do not fear, sir, do not fear!	mn45	4	11	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.12	Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock, or eaten by a deer, or burnt by a forest fire, or picked up by a lumberjack, or eaten by termites, or it may not even be fertile.”	mn45	4	12	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.13	Pleasant is the touch of this creeper’s tender, soft, and downy tendrils.’	mn45	4	13	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.14	Then the creeper enfolded the sal tree,	mn45	4	14	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.15	made a canopy over it,	mn45	4	15	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.16	draped a curtain around it,	mn45	4	16	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.17	and split apart all the main branches.	mn45	4	17	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.18	Then the deity thought,	mn45	4	18	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.19	‘This is the future danger that my friends saw!	mn45	4	19	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices

mn45:4.22	In the same way, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’ …	mn45	4	22	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:4.34	This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.	mn45	4	34	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.1	And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain?	mn45	5	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.2	It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	mn45	5	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.3	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	mn45	5	3	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.4	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	mn45	5	4	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.5	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	mn45	5	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.6	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	mn45	5	6	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.7	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	mn45	5	7	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.8	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	mn45	5	8	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.9	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.	mn45	5	9	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.10	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	mn45	5	10	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.11	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	mn45	5	11	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.12	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	mn45	5	12	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.13	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	mn45	5	13	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.14	And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	mn45	5	14	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.15	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn45	5	15	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:5.16	This is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.	mn45	5	16	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:6.1	And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure?	mn45	6	1	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:6.2	It’s when someone is ordinarily full of acute greed, hate, and delusion. They often feel the pain and sadness that greed, hate, and delusion bring.	mn45	6	2	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn45:6.5	They lead the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful faces.	mn45	6	5	mn	45	The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices

mn46:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn46	1	2	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn46	1	3	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn46	1	4	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn46	1	5	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn46	1	6	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.1	“Mendicants, sentient beings typically have the wish, desire, and hope:	mn46	2	1	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.2	‘Oh, if only unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things would decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things would increase!’	mn46	2	2	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.3	But exactly the opposite happens to them.	mn46	2	3	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.4	What do you take to be the reason for this?”	mn46	2	4	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.5	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn46	2	5	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices

mn46:2.7	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn46	2	7	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:2.8	The Buddha said this:	mn46	2	8	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.1	“Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn46	3	1	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.2	They don’t know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.	mn46	3	2	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.3	So they cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they should.	mn46	3	3	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.4	When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease.	mn46	3	4	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.5	Why is that?	mn46	3	5	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:3.6	Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.	mn46	3	6	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:4.1	But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn46	4	1	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:4.2	They know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.	mn46	4	2	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:4.3	So they cultivate and foster practices they should, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t.	mn46	4	3	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices

mn46:22.1	It’s like the last month of the rainy season, in autumn,  when the heavens are clear and cloudless. And as the sun is rising to the firmament, having dispelled all the darkness of space, it shines and glows and radiates.	mn46	22	1	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:22.2	In the same way, this way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure dispels the doctrines of the various other ascetics and brahmins as it shines and glows and radiates.”	mn46	22	2	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:22.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn46	22	3	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
mn46:22.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn46	22	4	mn	46	The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices

mn47:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn47	1	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn47	1	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:2.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One to understand whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or not.”	mn47	2	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:3.1	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn47	3	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:3.2	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn47	3	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:3.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn47	3	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:3.4	The Buddha said this:	mn47	3	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:4.1	“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One for two things—things that can be seen and heard:	mn47	4	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:4.2	‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	mn47	4	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:4.3	Scrutinizing him they find that	mn47	4	3	mn	47	The Inquirer

mn47:5.4	Scrutinizing him they find that	mn47	5	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:5.5	nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.	mn47	5	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:6.2	They scrutinize further:	mn47	6	2	mn	47	The Inquirer

mn47:6.5	clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.	mn47	6	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:7.2	They scrutinize further:	mn47	7	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:7.3	‘Did the venerable attain this skillful state a long time ago, or just recently?’	mn47	7	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:7.4	Scrutinizing him they find that	mn47	7	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:7.5	the venerable attained this skillful state a long time ago, not just recently.	mn47	7	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.2	They scrutinize further:	mn47	8	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.3	‘Are certain dangers found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown?’	mn47	8	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.4	For, mendicants, so long as a mendicant has not achieved fame and renown, certain dangers are not found in them.	mn47	8	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.5	But when they achieve fame and renown, those dangers appear.	mn47	8	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.6	Scrutinizing him they find that	mn47	8	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:8.7	those dangers are not found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown.	mn47	8	7	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.2	They scrutinize further:	mn47	9	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.3	‘Is this venerable securely stilled or insecurely stilled?	mn47	9	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.4	Is the reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures that they’re free of greed because greed has ended?’	mn47	9	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.5	Scrutinizing him they find that	mn47	9	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.6	that venerable is securely stilled, not insecurely stilled.	mn47	9	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:9.7	The reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that they’re free of greed because greed has ended.	mn47	9	7	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.1	If others should ask that mendicant,	mn47	10	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.2	‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’	mn47	10	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.5	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,	mn47	10	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.6	‘Because, whether that venerable is staying in a community or alone, some people there are in a good state or a sorry state, some instruct a group, and some are seen among pleasures of the flesh while others remain unsullied. Yet that venerable doesn’t look down on them for that.	mn47	10	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.7	Also, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	mn47	10	7	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:10.8	“I am securely stilled, not insecurely stilled. The reason I don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that I’m free of greed because greed has ended.”’	mn47	10	8	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:11.1	Next, they should ask the Realized One himself about this,	mn47	11	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:11.2	‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	mn47	11	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:11.3	The Realized One would answer,	mn47	11	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:11.4	‘Nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’	mn47	11	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:12.1	‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	mn47	12	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:12.2	The Realized One would answer,	mn47	12	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:12.3	‘Nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’	mn47	12	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:13.1	‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’	mn47	13	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:13.2	The Realized One would answer,	mn47	13	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:13.3	‘Clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.	mn47	13	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:13.4	I am the scope and the range of that, but I am not determined by that.’	mn47	13	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:14.1	A disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teaching.	mn47	14	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:14.2	The teacher explains Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.	mn47	14	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:14.3	When they directly know a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how they were taught, the mendicant comes to a conclusion about the teachings. They have confidence in the teacher:	mn47	14	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:14.4	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!’	mn47	14	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.1	If others should ask that mendicant,	mn47	15	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.2	‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’	mn47	15	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.4	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,	mn47	15	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.5	‘Reverends, I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching.	mn47	15	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.6	He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.	mn47	15	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.7	When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher:	mn47	15	7	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:15.8	“The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!”’	mn47	15	8	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.1	When someone’s faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner, with these words and phrases, it’s said to be grounded faith that’s based on evidence.	mn47	16	1	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.2	It is strong, and cannot be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	mn47	16	2	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.3	That is how there is legitimate scrutiny of the Realized One,	mn47	16	3	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.4	and that is how the Realized One is legitimately well-scrutinized.”	mn47	16	4	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn47	16	5	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn47:16.6	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn47	16	6	mn	47	The Inquirer
mn48:1.1	So I have heard.	mn48	1	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	mn48	1	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:2.1	Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	mn48	2	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:2.2	They couldn’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor could they convince each other or be convinced.	mn48	2	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	mn48	3	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	mn48	4	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell those mendicants that	mn48	4	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.3	the teacher summons them.”	mn48	4	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said,	mn48	4	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.5	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	mn48	4	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.6	“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,	mn48	4	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.7	“Is it really true, mendicants, that you have been arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words?	mn48	4	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.8	And that you can’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor can you convince each other or be convinced?”	mn48	4	8	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:4.9	“Yes, sir,” they said.	mn48	4	9	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.1	“What do you think, mendicants?	mn48	5	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.2	When you’re arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words, are you treating your spiritual companions with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private?”	mn48	5	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.3	“No, sir.”	mn48	5	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.4	“So it seems that when you’re arguing you are not treating each other with kindness.	mn48	5	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.5	So what exactly do you know and see, you futile men, that you behave in such a way?	mn48	5	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:5.6	This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”	mn48	5	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	mn48	6	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.2	“Mendicants, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn48	6	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.3	What six?	mn48	6	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.4	Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private.	mn48	6	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.5	This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn48	6	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.6	Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness …	mn48	6	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.8	Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …	mn48	6	8	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.10	Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material things they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions …	mn48	6	10	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.12	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. …	mn48	6	12	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.14	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.	mn48	6	14	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.15	This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn48	6	15	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:6.16	These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn48	6	16	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:7.1	Of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.	mn48	7	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:7.2	It’s like a bungalow. The roof-peak is the chief point, which holds and binds everything together.	mn48	7	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:7.3	In the same way, of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.	mn48	7	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.1	And how does the view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering?	mn48	8	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.2	It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this,	mn48	8	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.3	‘Is there anything that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see?’	mn48	8	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.4	If a mendicant is overcome with sensual desire, it’s their mind that’s overcome.	mn48	8	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.5	If a mendicant is overcome with ill will,	mn48	8	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.6	dullness and drowsiness,	mn48	8	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.7	restlessness and remorse,	mn48	8	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.8	doubt,	mn48	8	8	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.9	pursuing speculation about this world,	mn48	8	9	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.10	pursuing speculation about the next world,	mn48	8	10	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.11	or arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding others with barbed words, it’s their mind that’s overcome.	mn48	8	11	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.12	They understand,	mn48	8	12	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.13	‘There is nothing that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see.	mn48	8	13	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.14	My mind is properly disposed for awakening to the truths.’	mn48	8	14	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:8.15	This is the first knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is distinct from that of ordinary people.	mn48	8	15	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:9.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	9	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:9.2	‘When I develop, cultivate, and make much of this view, do I personally gain serenity and quenching?’	mn48	9	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:9.3	They understand,	mn48	9	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:9.4	‘When I develop, cultivate, and make much of this view, I personally gain serenity and quenching.’	mn48	9	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:9.5	This is their second knowledge …	mn48	9	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:10.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	10	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:10.2	‘Are there any ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I have?’	mn48	10	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:10.3	They understand,	mn48	10	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:10.4	‘There are no ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I have.’	mn48	10	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:10.5	This is their third knowledge …	mn48	10	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	11	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.2	‘Do I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view?’	mn48	11	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.3	And what, mendicants, is the nature of a person accomplished in view?	mn48	11	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.4	This is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	mn48	11	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.5	Though they may fall into a kind of offense for which resolution is possible, they quickly disclose, clarify, and reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.	mn48	11	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.6	And having revealed it they restrain themselves in the future.	mn48	11	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.7	Suppose there was a little baby boy. If he puts his hand or foot on a burning coal, he quickly pulls it back.	mn48	11	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.8	In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	mn48	11	8	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.9	Though they may still fall into a kind of offense for which resolution is possible, they quickly reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.	mn48	11	9	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.10	And having revealed it they restrain themselves in the future.	mn48	11	10	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.11	They understand,	mn48	11	11	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.12	‘I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view.’	mn48	11	12	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:11.13	This is their fourth knowledge …	mn48	11	13	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	12	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.2	‘Do I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view?’	mn48	12	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.3	And what, mendicants, is the nature of a person accomplished in view?	mn48	12	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.4	This is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	mn48	12	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.5	Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.	mn48	12	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.6	Suppose there was a cow with a baby calf. She watches her calf devotedly as she grazes.	mn48	12	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.7	In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.	mn48	12	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.8	Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.	mn48	12	8	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.9	They understand,	mn48	12	9	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.10	‘I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view.’	mn48	12	10	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:12.11	This is their fifth knowledge …	mn48	12	11	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	13	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.2	‘Do I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view?’	mn48	13	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.3	And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?	mn48	13	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.4	The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they pay attention, apply the mind, concentrate wholeheartedly, and actively listen to the teaching.	mn48	13	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.5	They understand,	mn48	13	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.6	‘I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view.’	mn48	13	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:13.7	This is their sixth knowledge …	mn48	13	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.1	Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,	mn48	14	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.2	‘Do I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view?’	mn48	14	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.3	And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?	mn48	14	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.4	The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.	mn48	14	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.5	They understand,	mn48	14	5	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.6	‘I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view.’	mn48	14	6	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:14.7	This is the seventh knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is distinct from that of ordinary people.	mn48	14	7	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:15.1	When a noble disciple has these seven factors, they have properly investigated their nature through the realization of the fruit of stream-entry.	mn48	15	1	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:15.2	A noble disciple with these seven factors has the fruit of stream-entry.”	mn48	15	2	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn48	15	3	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn48:15.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn48	15	4	mn	48	The Mendicants of Kosambī
mn49:1.1	So I have heard.	mn49	1	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn49	1	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn49	1	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn49	1	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn49	1	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn49	1	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:2.1	“This one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.	mn49	2	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:2.2	Now at that time Baka the Divinity had the following harmful misconception:	mn49	2	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:2.3	‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’	mn49	2	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.1	Then I knew what Baka the Divinity was thinking.	mn49	3	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.2	As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that realm of divinity.	mn49	3	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.3	Baka saw me coming off in the distance	mn49	3	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.4	and said,	mn49	3	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.5	‘Come, good fellow! Welcome, good fellow!	mn49	3	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.6	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn49	3	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:3.7	For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is not liable to pass away. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.’	mn49	3	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.1	When he had spoken, I said to him,	mn49	4	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.2	‘Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance! Oh lord, Baka the Divinity is lost in ignorance!	mn49	4	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.3	Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and liable to pass away, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away.	mn49	4	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.4	And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that	mn49	4	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.5	there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.	mn49	4	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:4.6	And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.’	mn49	4	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of the retinue of Divinity and said this to me,	mn49	5	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.2	‘Mendicant, mendicant! Don’t attack this one! Don’t attack this one! For this is the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.	mn49	5	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.3	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who criticized and loathed earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.	mn49	5	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.4	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.	mn49	5	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who praised and approved earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, and the Divinity.	mn49	5	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.6	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.	mn49	5	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.7	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	mn49	5	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.8	please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.	mn49	5	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.9	If you do, then you’ll end up like a person who, when approached by Lady Luck, would ward her off with a staff; or who, as they are falling over a cliff, would lose grip of the ground with their hands and feet.	mn49	5	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.10	Please, good fellow, do exactly what the Divinity says. Don’t go beyond the word of the Divinity.	mn49	5	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.11	Do you not see the assembly of the Divinity gathered here?’	mn49	5	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:5.12	And so Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of the Divinity to me.	mn49	5	12	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.1	When he had spoken, I said to Māra,	mn49	6	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.2	‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,	mn49	6	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.3	“He does not know me.”	mn49	6	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	mn49	6	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.5	And the Divinity, the Divinity’s assembly, and the retinue of Divinity have all fallen into your hands; they’re under your sway.	mn49	6	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.6	And you think,	mn49	6	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.7	“Maybe this one, too, has fallen into my hands; maybe he’s under my sway!”	mn49	6	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:6.8	But I haven’t fallen into your hands; I’m not under your sway.’	mn49	6	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.1	When I had spoken, Baka the Divinity said to me,	mn49	7	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.2	‘But, good fellow, what I say is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away is in fact permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and not liable to pass away. And where I say there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn there is in fact	mn49	7	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.3	no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.	mn49	7	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.4	And when I say there’s no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this.	mn49	7	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you, mendicant, whose deeds of fervent mortification lasted as long as your entire life.	mn49	7	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.6	When there was another escape beyond this they knew it, and when there was no other escape beyond this, they knew it.	mn49	7	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.7	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	mn49	7	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.8	you will never find another escape beyond this, and you will eventually get weary and frustrated.	mn49	7	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.9	If you attach to earth, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.	mn49	7	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.10	If you attach to water …	mn49	7	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.11	fire …	mn49	7	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.12	air …	mn49	7	12	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity

mn49:7.15	the Progenitor …	mn49	7	15	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:7.16	the Divinity, you will lie close to me, in my domain, subject to my will, and expendable.’	mn49	7	16	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.1	‘Divinity, I too know that	mn49	8	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.2	if I attach to earth, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable.	mn49	8	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.3	If I attach to water …	mn49	8	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity

mn49:8.8	the Progenitor …	mn49	8	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.9	the Divinity, I will lie close to you, in your domain, subject to your will, and expendable. And in addition, Divinity, I understand your range and your light:	mn49	8	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.10	“That’s how powerful is Baka the Divinity, how illustrious and mighty.”’	mn49	8	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:8.11	‘But in what way do you understand my range and my light?’	mn49	8	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.1	‘A galaxy extends a thousand times as far	mn49	9	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.2	as the moon and sun revolve	mn49	9	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.3	and the shining ones light up the quarters.	mn49	9	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.4	And there you wield your power.	mn49	9	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.5	You know the high and low,	mn49	9	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.6	the passionate and dispassionate,	mn49	9	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.7	and the coming and going of sentient beings	mn49	9	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.8	from this realm to another.	mn49	9	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:9.9	That’s how I understand your range and your light.	mn49	9	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.1	But there are three other realms that you don’t know or see,	mn49	10	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.2	but which I know and see.	mn49	10	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.3	There is the realm named after the gods of streaming radiance. You passed away from there and were reborn here.	mn49	10	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.4	You’ve dwelt here so long that you’ve forgotten about that, so you don’t know it or see it.	mn49	10	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.5	But I know it and see it.	mn49	10	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.6	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	mn49	10	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.7	Rather, I know more than you.	mn49	10	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.8	There is the realm named after the gods of universal beauty … There is the realm named after the gods of abundant fruit, which you don’t know or see.	mn49	10	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.9	But I know it and see it.	mn49	10	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.10	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	mn49	10	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:10.11	Rather, I know more than you.	mn49	10	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:11.1	Since directly knowing earth as earth, and since directly knowing that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by earth, I have not become earth, I have not become in earth, I have not become as earth, I have not become one who thinks ‘earth is mine’, I have not affirmed earth.	mn49	11	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:11.2	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	mn49	11	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:11.3	Rather, I know more than you.	mn49	11	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:12.1	Since directly knowing water …	mn49	12	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity

mn49:22.1	the Vanquisher …	mn49	22	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:23.1	Since directly knowing all as all, and since directly knowing that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by all, I have not become all, I have not become in all, I have not become as all, I have not become one who thinks ‘all is mine’, I have not affirmed all.	mn49	23	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:23.2	So Divinity, I am not your equal in knowledge, let alone your inferior.	mn49	23	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:23.3	Rather, I know more than you.’	mn49	23	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:24.1	‘Well, good fellow, if you have directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by all, may that not be vacuous and hollow for you!	mn49	24	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:25.1	Consciousness where no form appears,	mn49	25	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:25.2	infinite, luminous all-round.	mn49	25	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:25.3	That is what does not fall within the scope of experience characterized by earth, water, fire, air, creatures, gods, the Progenitor, the Divinity, the gods of streaming radiance, the gods of universal beauty, the gods of abundant fruit, the Vanquisher, and the all.	mn49	25	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.1	Well look now, good fellow, I will vanish from you!’	mn49	26	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.2	‘All right, then, Divinity, vanish from me—if you can.’	mn49	26	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.3	Then Baka the Divinity said,	mn49	26	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.4	‘I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama! I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama!’ But he was unable to vanish from me.	mn49	26	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.5	So I said to him,	mn49	26	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.6	‘Well now, Divinity, I will vanish from you!’	mn49	26	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.7	‘All right, then, good fellow, vanish from me—if you can.’	mn49	26	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.8	Then I used my psychic power to will that	mn49	26	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.9	my voice would extend so that Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue would hear me, but they would not see me.	mn49	26	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:26.10	And while vanished I recited this verse:	mn49	26	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:27.1	‘Seeing the danger in continued existence—	mn49	27	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:27.2	that life in any existence will cease to be—	mn49	27	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:27.3	I didn’t affirm any kind of existence,	mn49	27	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:27.4	and didn’t grasp at relishing.’	mn49	27	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:28.1	Then the Divinity, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	mn49	28	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:28.2	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn49	28	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:28.3	The ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might! We’ve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan.	mn49	28	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:28.4	Though people enjoy continued existence, loving it so much, he has extracted it, root and all.’	mn49	28	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.1	Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of the retinue of Divinity and said this to me,	mn49	29	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.2	‘If such is your understanding, good fellow, do not present it to your disciples or those gone forth!	mn49	29	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.3	Do not teach this Dhamma to your disciples or those gone forth!	mn49	29	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.4	Do not wish this for your disciples or those gone forth!	mn49	29	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.5	There have been ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.	mn49	29	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.6	They presented, taught, and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth.	mn49	29	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.7	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm.	mn49	29	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.8	But there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you, mendicant, who claimed to be perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.	mn49	29	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.9	They did not present, teach, or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth.	mn49	29	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.10	When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm.	mn49	29	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.11	So, mendicant, I tell you this:	mn49	29	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:29.12	please, good fellow, remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life, for this is better left unsaid. Good fellow, do not instruct others.’	mn49	29	12	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.1	When he had spoken, I said to Māra,	mn49	30	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.2	‘I know you, Wicked One. Do not think,	mn49	30	2	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.3	“He doesn’t know me.”	mn49	30	3	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	mn49	30	4	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.5	You don’t speak to me like this out of sympathy,	mn49	30	5	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.6	but with no sympathy.	mn49	30	6	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.7	For you think,	mn49	30	7	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.8	“Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach.”	mn49	30	8	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.9	Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas.	mn49	30	9	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.10	But I am.	mn49	30	10	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.11	The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples.	mn49	30	11	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.12	The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples.	mn49	30	12	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.13	Why is that?	mn49	30	13	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.14	Because the Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn49	30	14	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.15	He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	mn49	30	15	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.16	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	mn49	30	16	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.17	the Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn49	30	17	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:30.18	He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.’”	mn49	30	18	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn49:31.1	And so, because of the silencing of Māra, and because of the invitation of the Divinity, the name of this discussion is “On the Invitation of Divinity”.	mn49	31	1	mn	49	On the Invitation of Divinity
mn50:1.1	So I have heard.	mn50	1	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	mn50	1	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.1	At that time Moggallāna was walking mindfully in the open air.	mn50	2	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.2	Now at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallāna’s belly.	mn50	2	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.3	Moggallāna thought,	mn50	2	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.4	“Why now is my belly so very heavy,	mn50	2	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.5	like I’ve just eaten a load of beans?”	mn50	2	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:2.6	Then he stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, sat down on the seat spread out,	mn50	2	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.1	and investigated inside himself.	mn50	3	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.2	He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly.	mn50	3	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.3	So he said to Māra,	mn50	3	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.4	“Come out, Wicked One,	mn50	3	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.5	come out!	mn50	3	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.6	Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple.	mn50	3	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:3.7	Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!”	mn50	3	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:4.1	Then Māra thought,	mn50	4	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:4.2	“This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.	mn50	4	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:4.7	Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?”	mn50	4	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.1	Then Moggallāna said to Māra,	mn50	5	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.2	“I know you even when you’re like this, Wicked One. Do not think,	mn50	5	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.3	‘He doesn’t know me.’	mn50	5	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.4	You are Māra the Wicked.	mn50	5	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.5	And you think,	mn50	5	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.6	‘This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out.	mn50	5	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:5.11	Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?’”	mn50	5	11	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:6.1	Then Māra thought,	mn50	6	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:6.2	“This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out.”	mn50	6	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:6.7	Then Māra came up out of Moggallāna’s mouth and stood against the door.	mn50	6	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:7.1	Moggallāna saw him there	mn50	7	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:7.2	and said,	mn50	7	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:7.3	“I see you even there, Wicked One. Do not think,	mn50	7	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:7.4	‘He doesn’t see me.’	mn50	7	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:7.5	That’s you, Wicked One, standing against the door.	mn50	7	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:8.1	Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī.	mn50	8	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:8.2	You were her son,	mn50	8	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:8.3	which made you my nephew.	mn50	8	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:9.1	At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.	mn50	9	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:9.2	Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.	mn50	9	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:9.3	Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha,	mn50	9	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:9.4	none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma.	mn50	9	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:9.5	And that’s how he came to be known as Vidhura.	mn50	9	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.1	But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling.	mn50	10	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.2	Once upon a time, Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling.	mn50	10	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.3	Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there	mn50	10	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.4	and said,	mn50	10	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.5	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn50	10	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.6	This ascetic passed away while seated.	mn50	10	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.7	We should cremate him.’	mn50	10	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:10.8	They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left.	mn50	10	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.1	Then, when the night had passed, Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he robed up and entered the village for alms.	mn50	11	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.2	Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms	mn50	11	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.3	and said,	mn50	11	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.4	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn50	11	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.5	This ascetic passed away while seated, and now he has come back to life!’	mn50	11	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:11.6	And that’s how he came to be known as Sañjīva.	mn50	11	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.1	Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī,	mn50	12	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.2	‘I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character.	mn50	12	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.3	Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say,	mn50	12	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.4	“Come, all of you, abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the ethical mendicants of good character.	mn50	12	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.5	Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’	mn50	12	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:12.6	And that’s exactly what he did.	mn50	12	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.1	Then those brahmins and householders abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the ethical mendicants of good character:	mn50	13	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.2	‘These shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” Shoulders drooping, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.	mn50	13	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.3	They’re just like an owl on a branch, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse.	mn50	13	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.5	They’re just like a jackal on a river-bank, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a fish.	mn50	13	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.7	They’re just like a cat by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse.	mn50	13	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.9	They’re just like an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates.	mn50	13	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.10	In the same way, these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” Shoulders drooping, downcast, and dopey, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.’	mn50	13	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:13.11	Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn50	13	11	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.1	Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants:	mn50	14	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.2	‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī.	mn50	14	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.3	He told them to abuse you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability.	mn50	14	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.4	Come, all of you mendicants, meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn50	14	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.5	Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn50	14	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.6	Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	mn50	14	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:14.7	Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’	mn50	14	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:15.1	When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated spreading a heart full of love …	mn50	15	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:15.2	compassion …	mn50	15	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:15.3	rejoicing …	mn50	15	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:15.4	equanimity.	mn50	15	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:16.1	Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī,	mn50	16	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:16.2	‘Even when I do this I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character. Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say,	mn50	16	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:16.3	“Come, all of you, honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the ethical mendicants of good character.	mn50	16	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:16.4	Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’	mn50	16	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:17.1	And that’s exactly what he did.	mn50	17	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:17.4	Then those brahmins and householders honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated the ethical mendicants of good character.	mn50	17	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:17.5	Most of the people who died at that time—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	mn50	17	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:18.1	Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants:	mn50	18	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:18.2	‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī.	mn50	18	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:18.3	He told them to venerate you	mn50	18	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:18.4	in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability.	mn50	18	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:18.5	Come, all you mendicants, meditate observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.’	mn50	18	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:19.1	When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.	mn50	19	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:20.1	Then the Buddha Kakusandha robed up in the morning and, taking this bowl and robe, entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monk.	mn50	20	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:21.1	Then Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy, picked up a rock, and hit Vidhura on the head, cracking it open.	mn50	21	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:21.2	Then Vidhura, with blood pouring from his cracked skull, still followed behind the Buddha Kakusandha.	mn50	21	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:21.3	Then the Buddha Kakusandha turned to gaze back, the way that elephants do, saying,	mn50	21	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:21.4	‘This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds.’	mn50	21	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:21.5	And as he was gazing, Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great Hell.	mn50	21	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.1	Now that Great Hell is known by three names:	mn50	22	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.2	‘Related to the Six Fields of Contact’ and also ‘The Impaling With Spikes’ and also ‘Individually Painful’.	mn50	22	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.3	Then the wardens of hell came to me and said,	mn50	22	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.4	‘When spike meets spike in your heart,	mn50	22	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.5	you will know that	mn50	22	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:22.6	you’ve been roasting in hell for a thousand years.’	mn50	22	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:23.1	I roasted for many years, many centuries, many millennia in that Great Hell.	mn50	23	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:23.2	For ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell, experiencing the pain called ‘this is emergence’.	mn50	23	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:23.3	My body was in human form,	mn50	23	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:23.4	but I had the head of a fish.	mn50	23	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.1	What kind of hell was that,	mn50	24	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.2	where Dūsī was roasted	mn50	24	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.3	after attacking the disciple Vidhura	mn50	24	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.4	along with the brahmin Kakusandha?	mn50	24	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.5	There were 100 iron spikes,	mn50	24	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.6	each one individually painful.	mn50	24	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.7	That’s the kind of hell	mn50	24	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.8	where Dūsī was roasted	mn50	24	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.9	after attacking the disciple Vidhura	mn50	24	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.10	along with the brahmin Kakusandha.	mn50	24	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.11	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	24	11	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.12	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	24	12	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.13	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	24	13	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:24.14	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	24	14	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.1	There are mansions that last an eon	mn50	25	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.2	standing in the middle of a lake.	mn50	25	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.3	Sapphire-colored, brilliant,	mn50	25	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.4	they sparkle and shine.	mn50	25	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.5	Dancing there are nymphs	mn50	25	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.6	shining in all different colors.	mn50	25	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.7	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	25	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.8	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	25	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.9	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	25	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:25.10	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	25	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.1	I’m the one who, urged by the Buddha,	mn50	26	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.2	shook the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother	mn50	26	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.3	with his big toe	mn50	26	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.4	as the Saṅgha of mendicants watched.	mn50	26	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.5	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	26	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.6	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	26	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.7	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	26	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:26.8	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	26	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.1	I’m the one who shook the Palace of Victory	mn50	27	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.2	with his big toe	mn50	27	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.3	owing to psychic power,	mn50	27	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.4	inspiring deities to awe.	mn50	27	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.5	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	27	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.6	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	27	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.7	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	27	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:27.8	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	27	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.1	I’m the one who asked Sakka	mn50	28	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.2	in the Palace of Victory:	mn50	28	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.3	‘Vāsava, I hope you recall	mn50	28	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.4	the one who is freed through the ending of craving?’	mn50	28	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.5	And I’m the one to whom Sakka	mn50	28	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.6	admitted the truth when asked.	mn50	28	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.7	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	28	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.8	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	28	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.9	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	28	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:28.10	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	28	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.1	I’m the one who asked the Divinity	mn50	29	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.2	in the Hall of Justice before the assembly:	mn50	29	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.3	‘Good sir, do you still have the same view	mn50	29	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.4	that you had in the past?	mn50	29	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.5	Or do you see the radiance	mn50	29	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.6	transcending the realm of divinity?’	mn50	29	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.7	And I’m the one to whom the Divinity	mn50	29	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.8	truthfully admitted his progress:	mn50	29	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.9	‘Good fellow, I don’t have that view	mn50	29	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.10	that I had in the past.	mn50	29	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.11	I see the radiance	mn50	29	11	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.12	transcending the realm of divinity.	mn50	29	12	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.13	So how could I say today	mn50	29	13	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.14	that I am permanent and eternal?’	mn50	29	14	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.15	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	29	15	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.16	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	29	16	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.17	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	29	17	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:29.18	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	29	18	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.1	I’m the one who touched the peak of Mount Meru	mn50	30	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.2	using the power of meditative liberation.	mn50	30	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.3	I’ve visited the forests of the people	mn50	30	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.4	who dwell in the land east of Videha.	mn50	30	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.5	Dark One, if you attack	mn50	30	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.6	a mendicant who directly knows this,	mn50	30	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.7	a disciple of the Buddha,	mn50	30	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:30.8	you’ll fall into suffering.	mn50	30	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.1	Though a fire doesn’t think,	mn50	31	1	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.2	‘I’ll burn the fool!’	mn50	31	2	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.3	Still the fool who attacks	mn50	31	3	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.4	the fire gets burnt.	mn50	31	4	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.5	In the same way, Māra,	mn50	31	5	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.6	in attacking the Realized One,	mn50	31	6	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.7	you’ll only burn yourself,	mn50	31	7	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.8	like a fool touching the flames.	mn50	31	8	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.9	Māra’s done a bad thing	mn50	31	9	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.10	in attacking the Realized One.	mn50	31	10	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.11	Wicked One, do you imagine that	mn50	31	11	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.12	your wickedness won’t bear fruit?	mn50	31	12	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.13	Your deeds heap up wickedness	mn50	31	13	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.14	that will last a long time, terminator!	mn50	31	14	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.15	Give up on the Buddha, Māra!	mn50	31	15	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.16	And hold no hope for the mendicants!”	mn50	31	16	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.17	That is how, in the Bhesekaḷā grove,	mn50	31	17	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.18	the mendicant condemned Māra.	mn50	31	18	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.19	That spirit, downcast,	mn50	31	19	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn50:31.20	disappeared right there.	mn50	31	20	mn	50	The Condemnation of Māra
mn51:1.1	So I have heard.	mn51	1	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn51	1	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:1.3	Then Pessa the elephant driver’s son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha. When they had approached, Pessa bowed and sat down to one side.	mn51	1	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:1.4	But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side.	mn51	1	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:1.5	He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha, who were so very silent, and said to the Buddha:	mn51	1	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:2.1	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	mn51	2	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:2.2	How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by the worthy Gotama!	mn51	2	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:2.3	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so	mn51	2	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:2.4	like the worthy Gotama does in the present.”	mn51	2	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.1	“That’s so true, Kandaraka! That’s so true!	mn51	3	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.2	All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so	mn51	3	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.3	like I do in the present.	mn51	3	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.6	For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.	mn51	3	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.7	And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical, living consistently, alert, living alertly.	mn51	3	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.8	They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	mn51	3	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.9	What four?	mn51	3	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.10	It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn51	3	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.11	They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn51	3	11	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.12	They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn51	3	12	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:3.13	They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.”	mn51	3	13	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.1	When he had spoken, Pessa said to the Buddha:	mn51	4	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.2	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn51	4	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.3	How well described by the Buddha are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation! They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.	mn51	4	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.4	For we white-clothed laypeople also from time to time meditate with our minds well established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	mn51	4	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.5	We meditate observing an aspect of the body …	mn51	4	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.6	feelings …	mn51	4	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.7	mind …	mn51	4	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.8	principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn51	4	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.9	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn51	4	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.10	How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.	mn51	4	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.11	For human beings are shady, sir,	mn51	4	11	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.12	while beasts are obvious.	mn51	4	12	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.13	For I can drive an elephant in training,	mn51	4	13	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.14	and while going back and forth in Campā it’ll try all the tricks, bluffs, ruses, and feints that it can.	mn51	4	14	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.15	But my bondservants, servants, and workers behave one way by body, another by speech, and their minds another.	mn51	4	15	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.16	It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn51	4	16	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.17	How the Buddha knows what’s best for sentient beings, even though humans continue to be so shady, rotten, and tricky.	mn51	4	17	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.18	For human beings are shady, sir,	mn51	4	18	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:4.19	while beasts are obvious.”	mn51	4	19	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.1	“That’s so true, Pessa! That’s so true!	mn51	5	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.2	For human beings are shady,	mn51	5	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.3	while beasts are obvious.	mn51	5	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.4	Pessa, these four people are found in the world.	mn51	5	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.5	What four?	mn51	5	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.6	One person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	mn51	5	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.7	One person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.	mn51	5	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.8	One person mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	mn51	5	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.9	One person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	mn51	5	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.10	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.	mn51	5	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.11	Which one of these four people do you like the sound of?”	mn51	5	11	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.12	“Sir, I don’t like the sound of the first three people.	mn51	5	12	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:5.16	I only like the sound of the last person, who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others.”	mn51	5	16	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.1	“But why don’t you like the sound of those three people?”	mn51	6	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.2	“Sir, the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn51	6	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.3	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn51	6	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.4	The person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn51	6	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.5	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn51	6	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.6	The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn51	6	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.7	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn51	6	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.8	The person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn51	6	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.10	That’s why I like the sound of that person.	mn51	6	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.11	Well, now, sir, I must go.	mn51	6	11	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.12	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn51	6	12	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.13	“Please, Pessa, go at your convenience.”	mn51	6	13	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:6.14	And then Pessa the elephant driver’s son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn51	6	14	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.1	Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	mn51	7	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.2	“Mendicants, Pessa the elephant driver’s son is astute.	mn51	7	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.3	He has great wisdom.	mn51	7	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.4	If he had sat here an hour so that I could have analyzed these four people in detail, he would have greatly benefited.	mn51	7	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.5	Still, even with this much he has already greatly benefited.”	mn51	7	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.6	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	mn51	7	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.7	May the Buddha analyze these four people in detail. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn51	7	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.8	“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn51	7	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.9	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn51	7	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:7.10	The Buddha said this:	mn51	7	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.1	“And what person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when a person goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared for them, or an invitation for a meal.	mn51	8	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.2	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	mn51	8	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.3	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	mn51	8	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.4	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	mn51	8	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.5	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	mn51	8	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.6	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	mn51	8	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.7	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	mn51	8	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.8	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.	mn51	8	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.9	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	mn51	8	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.10	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	mn51	8	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.11	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	mn51	8	11	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.12	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	mn51	8	12	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.13	And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	mn51	8	13	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:8.14	This is called a person who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	mn51	8	14	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:9.1	And what person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others?	mn51	9	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:9.2	It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood.	mn51	9	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:9.3	This is called a person who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others.	mn51	9	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.1	And what person mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others?	mn51	10	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.2	It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	mn51	10	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.3	He has a new ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.	mn51	10	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.4	There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.	mn51	10	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.5	The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.	mn51	10	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.6	He says:	mn51	10	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.7	‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’	mn51	10	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.8	His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.	mn51	10	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:10.9	This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	mn51	10	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:11.1	And what person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, but lives without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine?	mn51	11	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:12.1	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	mn51	12	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:12.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn51	12	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:12.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn51	12	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	mn51	13	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.2	They gain faith in the Realized One	mn51	13	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.3	and reflect:	mn51	13	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	mn51	13	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn51	13	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn51	13	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:13.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn51	13	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	mn51	14	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	mn51	14	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.3	They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	mn51	14	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	mn51	14	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	mn51	14	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	mn51	14	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	mn51	14	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.8	They refrain from injuring plants and seeds.	mn51	14	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.9	They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.	mn51	14	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.10	They refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music .	mn51	14	10	mn	51	With Kandaraka

mn51:14.15	raw meat,	mn51	14	15	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.16	women and girls,	mn51	14	16	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.17	male and female bondservants,	mn51	14	17	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.18	goats and sheep,	mn51	14	18	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.19	chickens and pigs,	mn51	14	19	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.20	elephants, cows, horses, and mares,	mn51	14	20	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.21	and fields and land.	mn51	14	21	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.22	They refrain from running errands and messages;	mn51	14	22	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.23	buying and selling;	mn51	14	23	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:14.24	falsifying weights, metals, or measures;	mn51	14	24	mn	51	With Kandaraka

mn51:14.26	mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.	mn51	14	26	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:15.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	mn51	15	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:15.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	mn51	15	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:15.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	mn51	15	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:15.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	mn51	15	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn51	16	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	mn51	16	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …	mn51	16	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.4	When they smell an odor with their nose …	mn51	16	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.5	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	mn51	16	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.6	When they feel a touch with their body …	mn51	16	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.7	When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn51	16	7	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	mn51	16	8	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:16.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.	mn51	16	9	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:17.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	mn51	17	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:18.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	mn51	18	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:18.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn51	18	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.1	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	mn51	19	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.2	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	mn51	19	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.3	Giving up ill will, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will and malevolence.	mn51	19	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.4	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	mn51	19	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.5	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	mn51	19	5	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:19.6	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	mn51	19	6	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:20.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn51	20	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:20.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn51	20	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:21.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn51	21	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:22.1	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn51	22	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:23.1	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn51	23	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:24.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn51	24	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:24.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn51	24	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:25.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn51	25	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:25.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn51	25	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:26.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn51	26	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:26.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn51	26	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:27.1	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn51	27	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:27.2	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn51	27	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:27.3	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn51	27	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:27.4	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn51	27	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:28.1	This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	mn51	28	1	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:28.2	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.”	mn51	28	2	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:28.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn51	28	3	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn51:28.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn51	28	4	mn	51	With Kandaraka
mn52:1.1	So I have heard.	mn52	1	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:1.2	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.	mn52	1	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:1.3	Now at that time the householder Dasama, a wealthy citizen, had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.	mn52	1	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:2.1	He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn52	2	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:2.2	“Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying?	mn52	2	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:2.3	For I want to see him.”	mn52	2	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:2.4	“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”	mn52	2	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:3.1	Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:	mn52	3	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:3.2	“Honorable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke?”	mn52	3	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:3.3	“There is, householder.”	mn52	3	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:3.4	“And what is that one thing?”	mn52	3	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.1	“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn52	4	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.2	Then they reflect:	mn52	4	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.3	‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’	mn52	4	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’	mn52	4	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.5	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.	mn52	4	5	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	mn52	4	6	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:4.7	This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn52	4	7	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:5.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …	mn52	5	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:6.1	third absorption …	mn52	6	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:7.1	fourth absorption …	mn52	7	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn52	8	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:8.2	Then they reflect:	mn52	8	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:8.3	‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’	mn52	8	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:8.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …	mn52	8	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:9.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn52	9	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:10.1	rejoicing …	mn52	10	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:11.1	equanimity …	mn52	11	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:12.1	Furthermore, householder, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	mn52	12	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:12.2	Then they reflect:	mn52	12	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:12.3	‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’	mn52	12	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:12.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …	mn52	12	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …	mn52	13	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	mn52	14	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.2	Then they reflect:	mn52	14	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.3	‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’	mn52	14	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.4	They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’	mn52	14	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.5	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.	mn52	14	5	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.6	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	mn52	14	6	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:14.7	This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.”	mn52	14	7	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.1	When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn52	15	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.2	“Honorable Ānanda, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!	mn52	15	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.3	In the same way, I was searching for the door to freedom from death. And all at once I found eleven doors to freedom from death for cultivation.	mn52	15	3	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.4	Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors.	mn52	15	4	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.5	In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to freedom from death.	mn52	15	5	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:15.6	Sir, those of other religions seek a fee for the tutor. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”	mn52	15	6	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:16.1	Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn52	16	1	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn52:16.2	He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.	mn52	16	2	mn	52	The Wealthy Citizen
mn53:1.1	So I have heard.	mn53	1	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	mn53	1	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:2.1	Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	mn53	2	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:2.2	Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	mn53	2	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:2.3	“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	mn53	2	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:2.4	May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.	mn53	2	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:2.5	That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”	mn53	2	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:3.1	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn53	3	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:3.2	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,	mn53	3	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:3.3	bowed, stood to one side,	mn53	3	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:3.4	and told him of their preparations, saying,	mn53	3	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:3.6	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	mn53	3	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:4.1	Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.	mn53	4	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:4.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	mn53	4	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:4.3	The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	mn53	4	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.1	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda,	mn53	5	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.2	“Ānanda, speak about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu as you feel inspired.	mn53	5	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.3	My back is sore,	mn53	5	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.4	I’ll stretch it.”	mn53	5	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.5	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	mn53	5	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:5.6	And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	mn53	5	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:6.1	Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan:	mn53	6	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:6.2	“Mahānāma, a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	mn53	6	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:7.1	And how is a noble disciple accomplished in ethics?	mn53	7	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:7.2	It’s when a noble disciple is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	mn53	7	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:7.3	That’s how a noble disciple is ethical.	mn53	7	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.1	And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors?	mn53	8	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.2	When a noble disciple sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn53	8	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	mn53	8	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.4	When they hear a sound with their ears …	mn53	8	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.5	When they smell an odor with their nose …	mn53	8	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.6	When they taste a flavor with their tongue …	mn53	8	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.7	When they feel a touch with their body …	mn53	8	7	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.8	When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn53	8	8	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	mn53	8	9	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:8.10	That’s how a noble disciple guards the sense doors.	mn53	8	10	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:9.1	And how does a noble disciple eat in moderation?	mn53	9	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:9.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects rationally on the food that they eat:	mn53	9	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:9.3	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	mn53	9	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:9.4	That’s how a noble disciple eats in moderation.	mn53	9	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.1	And how is a noble disciple dedicated to wakefulness?	mn53	10	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.2	It’s when a noble disciple practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.	mn53	10	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.3	In the first watch of the night, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.	mn53	10	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.4	In the middle watch, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	mn53	10	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.5	In the last watch, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.	mn53	10	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:10.6	That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to wakefulness.	mn53	10	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:11.1	And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities?	mn53	11	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:11.2	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	mn53	11	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:11.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn53	11	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:12.1	They have a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.	mn53	12	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:13.1	They exercise prudence. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.	mn53	13	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:14.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	mn53	14	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:15.1	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	mn53	15	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:16.1	They’re mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.	mn53	16	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:17.1	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	mn53	17	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:17.2	That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities.	mn53	17	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.1	And how does a noble disciple get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty?	mn53	18	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.2	It’s when a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …	mn53	18	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.3	second absorption …	mn53	18	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.4	third absorption …	mn53	18	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.5	fourth absorption.	mn53	18	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:18.6	That’s how a noble disciple gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	mn53	18	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:19.1	When a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness; and they have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn53	19	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:19.2	Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken doesn’t wish,	mn53	19	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:19.3	‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’	mn53	19	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:19.4	Still they can break out and hatch safely.	mn53	19	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:19.5	In the same way, when a noble disciple is practicing all these things they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn53	19	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:20.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives.	mn53	20	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:20.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn53	20	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:20.3	This is their first breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.	mn53	20	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:21.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn53	21	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:21.2	This is their second breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.	mn53	21	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:22.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	mn53	22	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:22.2	This is their third breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.	mn53	22	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.1	A noble disciple’s conduct includes the following: being accomplished in ethics,	mn53	23	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.2	guarding the sense doors,	mn53	23	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.3	moderation in eating,	mn53	23	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.4	being dedicated to wakefulness,	mn53	23	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.5	having seven good qualities,	mn53	23	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:23.6	and getting the four absorptions when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	mn53	23	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:24.1	A noble disciple’s knowledge includes the following: recollecting their past lives,	mn53	24	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:24.2	clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,	mn53	24	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:24.3	and realizing the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life due to the ending of defilements.	mn53	24	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.1	This noble disciple is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’.	mn53	25	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.2	And the divinity Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:	mn53	25	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.3	‘The aristocrat is best among people	mn53	25	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.4	who take clan as the standard.	mn53	25	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.5	But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct	mn53	25	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.6	is best among gods and humans.’	mn53	25	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:25.7	And that verse was well sung by the Divinity Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Buddha.”	mn53	25	7	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.1	Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn53	26	1	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.2	“Good, good, Ānanda!	mn53	26	2	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.3	It’s good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing trainee.”	mn53	26	3	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.4	This is what Venerable Ānanda said,	mn53	26	4	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.5	and the teacher approved.	mn53	26	5	mn	53	A Trainee
mn53:26.6	Satisfied, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu approved what Venerable Ānanda said.	mn53	26	6	mn	53	A Trainee
mn54:1.1	So I have heard.	mn54	1	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	mn54	1	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	mn54	2	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:2.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	mn54	2	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	mn54	2	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.1	Potaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk. He was well dressed in sarong and cloak, with parasol and sandals. Having plunged deep into it, he went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn54	3	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and the Buddha said to him,	mn54	3	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.3	“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”	mn54	3	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.4	When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he stayed silent.	mn54	3	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.5	For a second time …	mn54	3	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.6	and a third time the Buddha said to him,	mn54	3	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.7	“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.”	mn54	3	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.8	When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he said to the Buddha,	mn54	3	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.9	“Worthy Gotama, it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as ‘householder’.”	mn54	3	9	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.10	“Well, householder, you have the features, attributes, and signs of a householder.”	mn54	3	10	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.11	“Worthy Gotama, it’s because I have refused all work and cut off all business.”	mn54	3	11	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.12	“Householder, in what way have you refused all work and cut off all business?”	mn54	3	12	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.13	“Worthy Gotama, all the money, grain, gold, and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance. And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them, but live with nothing more than food and clothes.	mn54	3	13	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.14	That’s how I have refused all work and cut off all business.”	mn54	3	14	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.15	“The cutting off of business as you describe it is one thing, householder, but the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training is quite different.”	mn54	3	15	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.16	“But what, sir, is cutting off of business in the noble one’s training?	mn54	3	16	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.17	Sir, please teach me this.”	mn54	3	17	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.18	“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn54	3	18	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:3.19	“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.	mn54	3	19	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.1	The Buddha said this:	mn54	4	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.2	“Householder, these eight things lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.	mn54	4	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.3	What eight?	mn54	4	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.4	Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.	mn54	4	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.5	Stealing should be given up, relying on not stealing.	mn54	4	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.6	Lying should be given up, relying on speaking the truth.	mn54	4	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.7	Divisive speech should be given up, relying on speech that isn’t divisive.	mn54	4	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.8	Greed and lust should be given up, relying on not being greedy and lustful.	mn54	4	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.9	Blaming and insulting should be given up, relying on not blaming and not insulting.	mn54	4	9	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.10	Anger and distress should be given up, relying on not being angry and distressed.	mn54	4	10	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.11	Arrogance should be given up, relying on not being arrogant.	mn54	4	11	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:4.12	These are the eight things—stated in brief without being analyzed in detail—that lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.”	mn54	4	12	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:5.1	“Sir, please teach me these eight things in detail out of sympathy.”	mn54	5	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:5.2	“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn54	5	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:5.3	“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.	mn54	5	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:5.4	The Buddha said this:	mn54	5	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.1	“‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn54	6	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:	mn54	6	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.3	‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creatures.	mn54	6	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.4	But if I were to kill living creatures, because of that I would reprimand myself; sensible people, after examination, would criticize me; and when my body breaks up, after death, I could expect to be reborn in a bad place.	mn54	6	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.5	And killing living creatures is itself a fetter and a hindrance.	mn54	6	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.6	The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of killing living creatures do not occur in someone who does not kill living creatures.’	mn54	6	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.7	‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’	mn54	6	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:6.8	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	mn54	6	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:7.1	‘Stealing …	mn54	7	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:8.1	lying …	mn54	8	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:9.1	divisive speech …	mn54	9	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder

mn54:11.1	blaming and insulting …	mn54	11	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:12.1	anger and distress …	mn54	12	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.1	Arrogance should be given up, relying on not being arrogant.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn54	13	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.2	It’s when a noble disciple reflects:	mn54	13	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.3	‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to be arrogant.	mn54	13	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.4	But if I were to be arrogant, because of that I would reprimand myself; sensible people, after examination, would criticize me; and when my body breaks up, after death, I could expect to be reborn in a bad place.	mn54	13	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.5	And arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance.	mn54	13	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.6	The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of arrogance do not occur in someone who is not arrogant.’	mn54	13	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.7	‘Arrogance should be given up by not being arrogant.’	mn54	13	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:13.8	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	mn54	13	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.1	These are the eight things—stated in brief and analyzed in detail—that lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.	mn54	14	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.2	But just this much does not constitute the cutting off of business in each and every respect in the noble one’s training.”	mn54	14	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.3	“But, sir, how is there the cutting off of business in each and every respect in the noble one’s training?	mn54	14	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.4	Sir, please teach me this.”	mn54	14	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.5	“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn54	14	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.6	“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya.	mn54	14	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:14.7	The Buddha said this:	mn54	14	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.1	“Householder, suppose a dog weak with hunger was hanging around a butcher’s shop.	mn54	15	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.2	A deft butcher or their apprentice would toss them a skeleton scraped clean of flesh and smeared in blood.	mn54	15	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.3	What do you think, householder?	mn54	15	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.4	Gnawing on such a fleshless skeleton, would that dog still get rid of its hunger?”	mn54	15	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.5	“No, sir.	mn54	15	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.6	Why not?	mn54	15	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.7	Because that skeleton is scraped clean of flesh and smeared in blood.	mn54	15	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.8	That dog will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn54	15	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.9	“In the same way, a noble disciple reflects:	mn54	15	9	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.10	‘With the simile of a skeleton the Buddha said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’	mn54	15	10	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:15.11	Having truly seen this with right understanding, they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity, where all kinds of grasping to the worldly pleasures of the flesh cease without anything left over.	mn54	15	11	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:16.1	Suppose a vulture or a crow or a hawk was to grab a scrap of meat and fly away.	mn54	16	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:16.2	Other vultures, crows, and hawks would keep chasing it, pecking and clawing.	mn54	16	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:16.3	What do you think, householder?	mn54	16	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:16.4	If that vulture, crow, or hawk doesn’t quickly let go of that scrap of meat, wouldn’t that result in death or deadly suffering for them?”	mn54	16	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:16.5	“Yes, sir.” …	mn54	16	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:17.1	“Suppose a person carrying a blazing grass torch was to walk against the wind.	mn54	17	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:17.2	What do you think, householder?	mn54	17	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:17.3	If that person doesn’t quickly let go of that blazing grass torch, wouldn’t they burn their hands or arm or other major or minor limb, resulting in death or deadly suffering for them?”	mn54	17	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:17.4	“Yes, sir.” …	mn54	17	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.1	“Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked.	mn54	18	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.2	Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	mn54	18	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.3	Two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals.	mn54	18	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.4	What do you think, householder?	mn54	18	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.5	Wouldn’t that person writhe and struggle to and fro?”	mn54	18	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.6	“Yes, sir.	mn54	18	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.7	Why is that?	mn54	18	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:18.8	For that person knows: ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that’d result in my death or deadly pain.’” …	mn54	18	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:19.1	“Suppose a person was to see delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds in a dream.	mn54	19	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:19.2	But when they woke they couldn’t see them at all. …	mn54	19	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.1	Suppose a man had borrowed some goods—a gentleman’s carriage and fine jeweled earrings—	mn54	20	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.2	and preceded and surrounded by these he proceeded through the middle of Āpaṇa.	mn54	20	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.3	When people saw him they’d say:	mn54	20	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.4	‘This must be a wealthy man! For that’s how the wealthy enjoy their wealth.’	mn54	20	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.5	But when the owners saw him, they’d take back what was theirs.	mn54	20	5	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.6	What do you think? Would that be enough for that man to get upset?”	mn54	20	6	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.7	“Yes, sir.	mn54	20	7	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.8	Why is that?	mn54	20	8	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:20.9	Because the owners took back what was theirs.” …	mn54	20	9	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:21.1	“Suppose there was a dense forest grove not far from a town or village.	mn54	21	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:21.2	And there was a tree laden with fruit, yet none of the fruit had fallen to the ground.	mn54	21	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:21.3	And along came a person in need of fruit, wandering in search of fruit.	mn54	21	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:21.4	Having plunged deep into that forest grove, they’d see that tree laden with fruit.	mn54	21	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder

mn54:21.18	If the first person, who climbed the tree, doesn’t quickly come down, when that tree fell wouldn’t they break their hand or arm or other major or minor limb, resulting in death or deadly suffering for them?”	mn54	21	18	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder

mn54:22.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives.	mn54	22	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:22.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn54	22	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:23.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn54	23	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:24.1	Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.

mn54:25.1	That’s how there is the cutting off of business in each and every respect in the noble one’s training.	mn54	25	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:25.2	What do you think, householder?	mn54	25	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:25.3	Do you regard yourself as having cut off business in a way comparable to the cutting off of business in each and every respect in the noble one’s training?”	mn54	25	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:25.4	“Who am I compared to one who has cut off business in each and every respect in the noble one’s training?	mn54	25	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder

mn54:26.1	Excellent, sir! Excellent!	mn54	26	1	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:26.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn54	26	2	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:26.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn54	26	3	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn54:26.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn54	26	4	mn	54	With Potaliya the Householder
mn55:1.1	So I have heard.	mn55	1	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.	mn55	1	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:2.1	Then Jīvaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:	mn55	2	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:3.1	“Sir, I have heard this:	mn55	3	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:3.2	‘They slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on his behalf: this is a deed he caused.’	mn55	3	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:3.3	I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	mn55	3	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:4.1	“Jīvaka, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.	mn55	4	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.1	In three cases I say that meat may not be eaten:	mn55	5	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.2	it’s seen, heard, or suspected.	mn55	5	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.3	These are three cases in which meat may not be eaten.	mn55	5	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.4	In three cases I say that meat may be eaten:	mn55	5	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.5	it’s not seen, heard, or suspected.	mn55	5	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:5.6	These are three cases in which meat may be eaten.	mn55	5	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.1	Take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.	mn55	6	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn55	6	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.3	A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.	mn55	6	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.4	The mendicant accepts if they want.	mn55	6	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.5	When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning, take their bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home, where they sit on the seat spread out.	mn55	6	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.6	That householder or their child serves them with delicious almsfood.	mn55	6	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.7	It never occurs to them,	mn55	6	7	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.8	‘It’s so good that this householder serves me with delicious almsfood!	mn55	6	8	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.9	I hope they serve me with such delicious almsfood in the future!’	mn55	6	9	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.10	They don’t think that.	mn55	6	10	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.11	They eat that almsfood untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.	mn55	6	11	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.12	What do you think, Jīvaka?	mn55	6	12	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.13	At that time is that mendicant intending to hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt both?”	mn55	6	13	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.14	“No, sir.”	mn55	6	14	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:6.15	“Aren’t they eating blameless food at that time?”	mn55	6	15	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.1	“Yes, sir.	mn55	7	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.2	Sir, I have heard that	mn55	7	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.3	The Divinity abides in love.	mn55	7	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.4	Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes,	mn55	7	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.5	and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.”	mn55	7	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.6	“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future.	mn55	7	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.7	If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”	mn55	7	7	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:7.8	“That’s exactly what I was referring to.”	mn55	7	8	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.1	“Take the case, Jīvaka, of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.	mn55	8-10	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn55	8-10	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	mn55	8-10	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.	mn55	8-10	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.5	In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn55	8-10	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.6	A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.	mn55	8-10	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka

mn55:8-10.16	At that time is that mendicant intending to hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt both?”	mn55	8-10	16	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.17	“No, sir.”	mn55	8-10	17	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:8-10.18	“Aren’t they eating blameless food at that time?”	mn55	8-10	18	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.1	“Yes, sir.	mn55	11	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.2	Sir, I have heard that	mn55	11	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.3	The Divinity abides in equanimity.	mn55	11	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.4	Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes,	mn55	11	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka

mn55:11.6	“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to cruelty, discontent, or repulsion has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future.	mn55	11	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.7	If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”	mn55	11	7	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:11.8	“That’s exactly what I was referring to.”	mn55	11	8	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.1	“Jīvaka, anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple creates much wickedness for five reasons.	mn55	12	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.2	When they say:	mn55	12	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.3	‘Go, fetch that living creature,’ this is the first reason.	mn55	12	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.4	When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s led along by a collar, this is the second reason.	mn55	12	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.5	When they say:	mn55	12	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.6	‘Go, slaughter that living creature,’ this is the third reason.	mn55	12	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.7	When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s being slaughtered, this is the fourth reason.	mn55	12	7	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.8	When they serve the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple with unallowable food, this is the fifth reason.	mn55	12	8	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:12.9	Anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple creates much wickedness for five reasons.”	mn55	12	9	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.1	When he had spoken, Jīvaka said to the Buddha:	mn55	13	1	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.2	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn55	13	2	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.3	The mendicants indeed eat allowable food.	mn55	13	3	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.4	The mendicants indeed eat blameless food.	mn55	13	4	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.5	Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	mn55	13	5	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn55:13.6	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn55	13	6	mn	55	With Jīvaka
mn56:1.1	So I have heard.	mn56	1	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.	mn56	1	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:2.1	At that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.	mn56	2	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:2.2	Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There he approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn56	2	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn56	2	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:2.4	“There are seats, Tapassī. Please sit if you wish.”	mn56	2	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.1	When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn56	3	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.2	The Buddha said to him,	mn56	3	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.3	“Tapassī, how many kinds of deed does the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan describe for performing bad deeds?”	mn56	3	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.4	“Reverend Gotama, the Jain Ñātika doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘deeds’.	mn56	3	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.5	He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.”	mn56	3	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.6	“Then how many kinds of rod does the Jain Ñātika describe for performing bad deeds?”	mn56	3	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.7	“The Jain Ñātika describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds:	mn56	3	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.8	the physical rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”	mn56	3	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.9	“But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?”	mn56	3	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.10	“Yes, each is quite distinct.”	mn56	3	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.11	“Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does the Jain Ñātika describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: the physical rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?”	mn56	3	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.12	“The Jain Ñātika describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	3	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.13	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	mn56	3	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.14	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	mn56	3	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.15	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	mn56	3	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.16	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	mn56	3	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.17	“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”	mn56	3	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.18	“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”	mn56	3	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:3.19	Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time.	mn56	3	19	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.1	When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Buddha,	mn56	4	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.2	“But Reverend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deeds?”	mn56	4	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.3	“Tapassī, the Realized One doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘rods’.	mn56	4	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.4	He usually speaks in terms of ‘deeds’.”	mn56	4	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.5	“Then how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deeds?”	mn56	4	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.6	“I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds:	mn56	4	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.7	physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds.”	mn56	4	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.8	“But are these kinds of deed all distinct from each other?”	mn56	4	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.9	“Yes, each is quite distinct.”	mn56	4	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.10	“Of the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated, which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: physical deeds, verbal deeds, or mental deeds?”	mn56	4	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.11	“I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much physical deeds or verbal deeds.”	mn56	4	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.12	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	mn56	4	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.13	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	mn56	4	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.14	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	mn56	4	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.15	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	mn56	4	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.16	“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?”	mn56	4	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.17	“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.”	mn56	4	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:4.18	Thus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time, after which he got up from his seat and went to see the Jain Ñātika.	mn56	4	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.1	Now at that time the Jain Ñātika was sitting together with a large assembly of Bālaki laypeople headed by Upāli.	mn56	5	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.2	The Jain Ñātika saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance	mn56	5	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.3	and said to him,	mn56	5	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.4	“So, Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	mn56	5	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.5	“Just now, sir, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	mn56	5	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.6	“But did you have some discussion with him?”	mn56	5	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.7	“I did.”	mn56	5	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.8	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	mn56	5	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:5.9	Then Dīgha Tapassī informed the Jain Ñātika of all they had discussed.	mn56	5	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:6.1	When he had spoken, the Jain Ñātika said to him,	mn56	6	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:6.2	“Good, good, Tapassī!	mn56	6	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:6.3	Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	mn56	6	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:6.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	mn56	6	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:6.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	6	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.1	When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him,	mn56	7	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.2	“Good, sir! Well done, Dīgha Tapassī!	mn56	7	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.3	The Honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	mn56	7	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	mn56	7	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.	mn56	7	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.6	I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point.	mn56	7	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.7	If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī, I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about!	mn56	7	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.8	Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!	mn56	7	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.9	Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!	mn56	7	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.10	I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!	mn56	7	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.11	Sir, I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.”	mn56	7	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.12	“Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	mn56	7	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:7.13	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	mn56	7	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.1	When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	mn56	8	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.2	“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	mn56	8	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.3	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.”	mn56	8	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.4	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	8	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.5	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.	mn56	8	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.6	Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	mn56	8	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:8.7	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	mn56	8	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.1	For a second time …	mn56	9	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.2	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	mn56	9	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.3	“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	mn56	9	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.4	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.”	mn56	9	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.5	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	9	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.6	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.	mn56	9	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.7	Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.	mn56	9	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.8	For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”	mn56	9	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.9	“Yes, sir,” replied the householder Upāli to the Jain Ñātika. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn56	9	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.10	“Sir, did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come here?”	mn56	9	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.11	“He did, householder.”	mn56	9	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.12	“But did you have some discussion with him?”	mn56	9	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.13	“I did.”	mn56	9	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.14	“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?”	mn56	9	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:9.15	Then the Buddha informed Upāli of all they had discussed.	mn56	9	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.1	When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him,	mn56	10	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.2	“Good, sir, well done by Tapassī!	mn56	10	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.3	The Jain ascetic Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.	mn56	10	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.4	For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod?	mn56	10	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.5	Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	10	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.6	“Householder, so long as you debate on the basis of truth, we can have some discussion about this.”	mn56	10	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.7	“I will debate on the basis of truth, sir.	mn56	10	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:10.8	Let us have some discussion about this.”	mn56	10	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.1	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	11	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.2	Take a Jain ascetic who is sick, suffering, gravely ill. They reject cold water and use only hot water.	mn56	11	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.3	Not getting cold water, they might die.	mn56	11	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.4	Now, where does the Jain Ñātika say they would be reborn?”	mn56	11	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.5	“Sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’. They would be reborn there.	mn56	11	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.6	Why is that?	mn56	11	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.7	Because they died with mental attachment.”	mn56	11	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.8	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	mn56	11	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.9	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	mn56	11	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.10	But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”	mn56	11	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:11.13	“Even though the Buddha says this, still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	11	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.1	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	12	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.2	Take a Jain ascetic who is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off evil in all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained.	mn56	12	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.3	When going out and coming back they accidentally injure many little creatures.	mn56	12	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.4	Now, what result does the Jain Ñātika say they would incur?”	mn56	12	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.5	“Sir, the Jain Ñātika says that unintentional acts are not very blameworthy.”	mn56	12	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.6	“But if they are intentional?”	mn56	12	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.7	“Then they are very blameworthy.”	mn56	12	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.8	“But where does the Jain Ñātika say that intention is classified?”	mn56	12	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.9	“In the mental rod, sir.”	mn56	12	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.10	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	mn56	12	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.11	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	mn56	12	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.12	But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”	mn56	12	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:12.15	“Even though the Buddha says this, still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	12	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.1	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.2	Is this Nāḷandā successful and prosperous, populous, full of people?”	mn56	13	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.3	“Indeed it is, sir.”	mn56	13	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.4	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.5	Suppose a man were to come along with a drawn sword	mn56	13	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.6	and say:	mn56	13	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.7	‘In one hour I will reduce all the living creatures within the bounds of Nāḷandā to one heap and mass of flesh!’	mn56	13	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.8	What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.9	Could he do that?”	mn56	13	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.10	“Sir, even ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty men couldn’t do that.	mn56	13	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.11	How impressive is one measly man?”	mn56	13	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.12	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.13	Suppose an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power, who has achieved mastery of the mind, were to come along	mn56	13	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.14	and say:	mn56	13	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.15	‘I will reduce Nāḷandā to ashes with a single malevolent act of will!’	mn56	13	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.16	What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.17	Could he do that?”	mn56	13	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.18	“Sir, an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power, who has achieved mastery of the mind, could reduce ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty Nāḷandās to ashes with a single malevolent act of will.	mn56	13	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.19	How impressive is one measly Nāḷandā?”	mn56	13	19	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.20	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	mn56	13	20	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.21	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	mn56	13	21	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.22	But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”	mn56	13	22	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.25	“Even though the Buddha says this, still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”	mn56	13	25	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.26	“What do you think, householder?	mn56	13	26	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.27	Have you heard how the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka, Kaliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga came to be that way?”	mn56	13	27	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:13.28	“I have, sir.”	mn56	13	28	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:14.1	“What have you heard?”	mn56	14	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:14.2	“I heard that it was because of a malevolent act of will by seers that the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka, Kaliṅga, Mejjha, and Mātaṅga came to be that way.”	mn56	14	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:14.3	“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.	mn56	14	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:14.4	What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.	mn56	14	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:14.5	But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth.”	mn56	14	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.1	“Sir, I was already delighted and satisfied by the Buddha’s very first simile.	mn56	15	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.2	Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the Buddha’s various solutions to the problem, so I thought I’d oppose you in this way.	mn56	15	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.3	Excellent, sir! Excellent!	mn56	15	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.4	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn56	15	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.5	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn56	15	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:15.6	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn56	15	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.1	“Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.”	mn56	16	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration.	mn56	16	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.3	For if the followers of other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Nāḷandā, saying:	mn56	16	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.4	‘The householder Upāli has become our disciple!’	mn56	16	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.5	And yet the Buddha says:	mn56	16	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.6	‘Householder, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.’	mn56	16	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.7	For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn56	16	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:16.8	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn56	16	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.1	“For a long time now, householder, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.”	mn56	17	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.2	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come.	mn56	17	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.3	I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:	mn56	17	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.4	‘Gifts should only be given to me, not to others.	mn56	17	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.5	Gifts should only be given to my disciples, not to the disciples of others.	mn56	17	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.6	Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others.	mn56	17	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.7	Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.’	mn56	17	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.8	Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics.	mn56	17	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.9	Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that.	mn56	17	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.10	For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn56	17	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:17.11	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn56	17	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.1	Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step, with	mn56	18	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	mn56	18	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.3	And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	mn56	18	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.4	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	mn56	18	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.5	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	mn56	18	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.6	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Upāli:	mn56	18	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.7	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	mn56	18	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.8	Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions.	mn56	18	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.9	He said to the Buddha, “Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn56	18	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:18.10	“Please, householder, go at your convenience.”	mn56	18	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.1	And then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went back to his own home, where he addressed the gatekeeper,	mn56	19	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.2	“My good gatekeeper, from this day forth close the gate to Jain monks and nuns, and open it for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	mn56	19	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.3	If any Jain ascetics come, say this to them:	mn56	19	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.4	‘Wait, sir, do not enter.	mn56	19	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	mn56	19	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.6	His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns, and opened for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	mn56	19	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.7	If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.’”	mn56	19	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:19.8	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper.	mn56	19	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.1	Dīgha Tapassī heard that	mn56	20	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.2	Upāli had become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	mn56	20	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.3	He went to the Jain Ñātika and said to him,	mn56	20	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.4	“Sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”	mn56	20	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.5	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	20	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.6	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	mn56	20	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.7	For a second time …	mn56	20	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.8	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika,	mn56	20	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.9	“Sir, they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.”	mn56	20	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.10	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	20	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.11	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	mn56	20	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.12	“Well, sir, I’d better go and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	mn56	20	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:20.13	“Go, Tapassī, and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	mn56	20	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.1	Then Dīgha Tapassī went to Upāli’s home.	mn56	21	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.2	The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance	mn56	21	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.3	and said to him,	mn56	21	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.4	“Wait, sir, do not enter.	mn56	21	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	mn56	21	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.6	His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns, and opened for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	mn56	21	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.7	If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.”	mn56	21	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.8	Saying, “No, worthy man, I do not require almsfood,” he turned back and went to the Jain Ñātika and said to him,	mn56	21	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.9	“Sir, it’s really true that Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	21	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.10	Sir, I couldn’t get you to accept that it wasn’t a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	mn56	21	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.11	For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.	mn56	21	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.12	The householder Upāli has been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”	mn56	21	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.13	“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.	mn56	21	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.14	But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple.”	mn56	21	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.15	For a second time …	mn56	21	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.18	and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī told the Jain Ñātika	mn56	21	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.19	that it was really true.	mn56	21	19	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.20	“It is impossible …	mn56	21	20	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:21.22	Well, Tapassī, I’d better go and find out for myself whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”	mn56	21	22	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.1	Then the Jain Ñātika went to Upāli’s home together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	mn56	22	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.2	The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance	mn56	22	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.3	and said to him:	mn56	22	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.4	“Wait, sir, do not enter.	mn56	22	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.5	From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	mn56	22	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.6	His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns, and opened for the Buddha’s monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.	mn56	22	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.7	If you require almsfood, wait here, they will bring it to you.”	mn56	22	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.8	“Well then, my good gatekeeper, go to Upāli and say:	mn56	22	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.9	‘Sir, the Jain Ñātika is waiting outside the gates together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	mn56	22	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.10	He wishes to see you.’”	mn56	22	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.11	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to Upāli and relayed what was said.	mn56	22	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.14	Upāli said to him, “Well, then, my good gatekeeper, prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate.”	mn56	22	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.15	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He did as he was asked, then returned to Upāli and said,	mn56	22	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.16	“Sir, seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gate.	mn56	22	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:22.17	Please go at your convenience.”	mn56	22	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.1	Then Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate, where he sat on the highest and finest seat. He addressed the gatekeeper,	mn56	23	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.2	“Well then, my good gatekeeper, go to the Jain Ñātika and say to him:	mn56	23	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.3	‘Sir, Upāli says	mn56	23	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.4	you may enter if you wish.’”	mn56	23	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.5	“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to the Jain Ñātika and relayed what was said.	mn56	23	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:23.8	Then the Jain Ñātika went to the hall of the middle gate together with a large following of Jain ascetics.	mn56	23	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:24.2	Previously, when Upāli saw the Jain Ñātika coming, he would go out to greet him and, having wiped off the highest and finest seat with his upper robe, he would embrace him and sit him down.	mn56	24	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:24.3	But today, having seated himself on the highest and finest seat, he said to the Jain Ñātika,	mn56	24	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:24.4	“There are seats, sir.	mn56	24	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:24.5	Please sit if you wish.”	mn56	24	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.1	When he said this, the Jain Ñātika said to him:	mn56	25	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.2	“You’re mad, householder! You’re a moron!	mn56	25	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.3	You said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine.	mn56	25	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.4	Suppose a man went to deliver a pair of testicles, but came back castrated. Or they went to deliver eyes, but came back blinded.	mn56	25	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.5	In the same way, you said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine.	mn56	25	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:25.6	You’ve been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion magic!”	mn56	25	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.1	“Sir, this conversion magic is excellent.	mn56	26	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.2	This conversion magic is lovely!	mn56	26	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.3	If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	mn56	26	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.4	If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	mn56	26	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.5	If the whole world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.	mn56	26	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.6	Well then, sir, I shall give you a simile.	mn56	26	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:26.7	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	mn56	26	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.1	Once upon a time there was an old brahmin, elderly and senior. His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birth.	mn56	27	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.2	Then she said to the brahmin,	mn56	27	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.3	‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’	mn56	27	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.4	When she said this, the brahmin said to her,	mn56	27	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.5	‘Wait, my dear, until you give birth.	mn56	27	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.6	If your child is a boy, I’ll buy you a male monkey,	mn56	27	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.7	but if it’s a girl, I’ll buy a female monkey.’	mn56	27	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.8	For a second time,	mn56	27	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.9	and a third time she said to the brahmin,	mn56	27	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.10	‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’	mn56	27	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.11	Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, bought a male baby monkey at the market, brought it to her, and said,	mn56	27	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.12	‘I’ve bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child.’	mn56	27	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.13	When he said this, she said to him,	mn56	27	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.14	‘Go, brahmin, take this monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and say,	mn56	27	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.15	“Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.”’	mn56	27	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.16	Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, took the monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said,	mn56	27	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.17	‘Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.’	mn56	27	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.18	When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him,	mn56	27	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.19	‘Sir, this monkey can withstand a dying, but not a pounding or a pressing.’	mn56	27	19	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.20	In the same way, the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initially—for fools, not for the astute—but can’t withstand being scrutinized or pressed.	mn56	27	20	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.21	Then some time later that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said,	mn56	27	21	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.22	‘Worthy Rattapāṇi, I wish to have this new pair of garments dyed the color of yellow greasepaint, pounded and re-pounded, and pressed on both sides.’	mn56	27	22	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.23	When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him,	mn56	27	23	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.24	‘Sir, this pair of garments can withstand a dying, a pounding, and a pressing.’	mn56	27	24	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:27.25	In the same way, the doctrine of the Buddha looks fine initially—for the astute, not for fools—and it can withstand being scrutinized and pressed.”	mn56	27	25	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:28.1	“Householder, the king and his retinue know you as	mn56	28	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:28.2	a disciple of the Jain Ñātika.	mn56	28	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:28.3	Whose disciple should we remember you as?”	mn56	28	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.1	When he had spoken, the householder Upāli got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms in the direction of the Buddha, and said to the Jain Ñātika,	mn56	29	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.2	“Well then, sir, hear whose disciple I am:	mn56	29	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.3	The attentive one, free of delusion,	mn56	29	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.4	with hard-heartedness dissolved, victor in battle;	mn56	29	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.5	he’s untroubled and very even-minded,	mn56	29	5	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.6	with the virtue of an elder and the wisdom of a saint,	mn56	29	6	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.7	immaculate in the midst of it all:	mn56	29	7	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.8	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	8	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.9	He has no indecision, he’s content,	mn56	29	9	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.10	joyful, he has spat out the world’s bait;	mn56	29	10	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.11	he has completed the ascetic’s task as a man,	mn56	29	11	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.12	a man who bears his final body;	mn56	29	12	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.13	he’s beyond compare, he’s stainless:	mn56	29	13	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.14	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	14	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.15	He’s free of doubt, he’s skillful,	mn56	29	15	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.16	he’s a trainer, an excellent charioteer;	mn56	29	16	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.17	supreme, with brilliant qualities,	mn56	29	17	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.18	confident, his light shines forth;	mn56	29	18	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.19	he has cut off conceit, he’s a hero:	mn56	29	19	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.20	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	20	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.21	The boss bull, immeasurable,	mn56	29	21	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.22	profound, sagacious;	mn56	29	22	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.23	he is the maker of sanctuary, knowledgeable,	mn56	29	23	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.24	firm in principle and restrained;	mn56	29	24	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.25	he has slipped his chains and is liberated:	mn56	29	25	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.26	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	26	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.27	He’s a giant, living remotely,	mn56	29	27	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.28	he’s ended the fetters and is liberated;	mn56	29	28	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.29	he’s skilled in debate and cleansed,	mn56	29	29	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.30	with banner lowered, desireless;	mn56	29	30	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.31	he’s tamed, and doesn’t proliferate:	mn56	29	31	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.32	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	32	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.33	He is the seventh sage, free of deceit,	mn56	29	33	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.34	with three knowledges, he has attained to divinity,	mn56	29	34	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.35	he has bathed, he knows philology,	mn56	29	35	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.36	he’s tranquil, he understands what is known;	mn56	29	36	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.37	he is Sakka the Able, Purindada the Firstgiver:	mn56	29	37	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.38	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	38	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.39	The noble one, evolved,	mn56	29	39	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.40	he has attained the goal and explains it;	mn56	29	40	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.41	he is mindful, discerning,	mn56	29	41	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.42	neither leaning forward nor pulling back,	mn56	29	42	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.43	he’s unstirred, attained to mastery:	mn56	29	43	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.44	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	44	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.45	Transcendent, he practices absorption,	mn56	29	45	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.46	no inner thoughts arising, he is pure,	mn56	29	46	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.47	independent and fearless;	mn56	29	47	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.48	secluded, he has reached the peak,	mn56	29	48	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.49	crossed over, he helps others across:	mn56	29	49	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.50	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	50	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.51	He’s peaceful, his wisdom is vast,	mn56	29	51	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.52	with great wisdom, he’s free of greed;	mn56	29	52	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.53	he is the Realized One, the Holy One,	mn56	29	53	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.54	unrivaled, unequaled,	mn56	29	54	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.55	assured, and subtle:	mn56	29	55	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.56	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.	mn56	29	56	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.57	He has cut off craving and is awakened,	mn56	29	57	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.58	free of fuming, unsullied;	mn56	29	58	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.59	a mighty spirit worthy of offerings,	mn56	29	59	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.60	best of men, inestimable,	mn56	29	60	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.61	grand, he has reached the peak of glory:	mn56	29	61	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:29.62	he is the Buddha, and I am his disciple.”	mn56	29	62	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:30.1	“But when did you compose these praises of the ascetic Gotama’s beautiful qualities, householder?”	mn56	30	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:30.2	“Sir, suppose there was a large heap of many different flowers. A deft garland-maker or their apprentice could tie them into a colorful garland.	mn56	30	2	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:30.3	In the same way, the Buddha has many beautiful qualities to praise, many hundreds of such qualities.	mn56	30	3	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:30.4	Who, sir, would not praise the praiseworthy?”	mn56	30	4	mn	56	With Upāli
mn56:31.1	Unable to bear this honor paid to the Buddha, the Jain Ñātika spewed hot blood from his mouth there and then.	mn56	31	1	mn	56	With Upāli
mn57:1.1	So I have heard.	mn57	1	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Haliddavasana.	mn57	1	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.1	Then Puṇṇa the Koliyan, a cow votary, and the naked ascetic Seniya, a dog votary, went to see the Buddha. Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side, while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog.	mn57	2	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.2	Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,	mn57	2	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.3	“Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya the dog votary does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.	mn57	2	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.4	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.	mn57	2	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.5	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	mn57	2	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.6	“Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”	mn57	2	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.7	For a second time …	mn57	2	7	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.8	and a third time, Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,	mn57	2	8	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.9	“Sir, this naked ascetic Seniya does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.	mn57	2	9	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.10	For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.	mn57	2	10	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.11	Where will he be reborn in his next life?”	mn57	2	11	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.12	“Clearly, Puṇṇa, I’m not getting through to you when I say:	mn57	2	12	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.13	‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’	mn57	2	13	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:2.14	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	mn57	2	14	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:3.1	Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s ethics, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.	mn57	3	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:3.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of dogs.	mn57	3	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:3.3	But if they have such a view: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.	mn57	3	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:3.4	An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.	mn57	3	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:3.5	So if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs, but if it fails it leads to hell.”	mn57	3	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:4.1	When he said this, Seniya cried and burst out in tears.	mn57	4	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:4.2	The Buddha said to Puṇṇa,	mn57	4	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:4.3	“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:	mn57	4	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog

mn57:4.18	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	mn57	4	18	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:5.1	Take someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a cow’s ethics, a cow’s mentality, and a cow’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.	mn57	5	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:5.2	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of cows.	mn57	5	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog

mn57:6.1	When he said this, Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tears.	mn57	6	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.2	The Buddha said to Seniya,	mn57	6	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.3	“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:	mn57	6	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog

mn57:6.6	But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cow.	mn57	6	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.7	I am quite confident that the Buddha	mn57	6	7	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.8	is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance, and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance.”	mn57	6	8	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.9	“Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn57	6	9	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.10	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	mn57	6	10	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:6.11	The Buddha said this:	mn57	6	11	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:7.1	“Puṇṇa, I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight.	mn57	7	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:7.2	What four?	mn57	7	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:7.3	There are dark deeds with dark results;	mn57	7	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog

mn57:7.6	neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.	mn57	7	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.1	And what are dark deeds with dark results?	mn57	8	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.2	It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn57	8	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.3	Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,	mn57	8	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.4	where hurtful contacts strike them.	mn57	8	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.5	Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.	mn57	8	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	mn57	8	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.7	For your deeds determine your rebirth,	mn57	8	7	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.8	and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.	mn57	8	8	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	mn57	8	9	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:8.10	These are called dark deeds with dark results.	mn57	8	10	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.1	And what are bright deeds with bright results?	mn57	9	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.2	It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn57	9	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.3	Having made these choices, they are reborn in a pleasing world,	mn57	9	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.4	where pleasing contacts strike them.	mn57	9	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.5	Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings of perfect happiness—like the gods of universal beauty.	mn57	9	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	mn57	9	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.7	For your deeds determine your rebirth,	mn57	9	7	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog

mn57:9.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	mn57	9	9	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:9.10	These are called bright deeds with bright results.	mn57	9	10	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.1	And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results?	mn57	10	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.2	It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn57	10	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.3	Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing,	mn57	10	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.4	where hurtful and pleasing contacts strike them.	mn57	10	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.5	Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.	mn57	10	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.6	This is how a being is born from a being.	mn57	10	6	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.7	For what you do brings about your rebirth,	mn57	10	7	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.8	and when you’re reborn contacts strike you.	mn57	10	8	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.9	This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.	mn57	10	9	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:10.10	These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.	mn57	10	10	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:11.1	And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds?	mn57	11	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:11.2	It’s the intention to give up dark deeds with dark results, bright deeds with bright results, and both dark and bright deeds with both dark and bright results.	mn57	11	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:11.3	These are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.	mn57	11	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:11.4	These are the four kinds of deeds that I declare, having realized them with my own insight.”	mn57	11	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:12.1	When he had spoken, Puṇṇa the Koliyan said to the Buddha,	mn57	12	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:12.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	mn57	12	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:12.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn57	12	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:13.1	And Seniya the naked ascetic said to the Buddha,	mn57	13	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:13.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	mn57	13	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:13.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn57	13	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:13.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	mn57	13	5	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:14.1	“Seniya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	mn57	14	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:14.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	mn57	14	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:14.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	mn57	14	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:15.1	And the naked ascetic Seniya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn57	15	1	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:15.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Seniya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn57	15	2	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:15.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn57	15	3	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn57:15.4	And Venerable Seniya became one of the perfected.	mn57	15	4	mn	57	The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
mn58:1.1	So I have heard.	mn58	1	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn58	1	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:2.1	Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him,	mn58	2	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.1	“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.	mn58	3	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.2	Then you will get a good reputation:	mn58	3	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.3	‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’”	mn58	3	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.4	“But sir, how am I to do this?”	mn58	3	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.5	“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:	mn58	3	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.6	‘Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’	mn58	3	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.7	When he’s asked this, if he answers:	mn58	3	7	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.8	‘He may, prince,’ say this to him,	mn58	3	8	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.9	‘Then, sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person?	mn58	3	9	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.10	For even an ordinary person may utter speech that is disliked by others.’	mn58	3	10	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.11	But if he answers,	mn58	3	11	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.12	‘He may not, prince,’ say this to him:	mn58	3	12	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.13	‘Then, sir, why exactly did you declare of Devadatta:	mn58	3	13	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.14	“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?	mn58	3	14	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.15	Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’	mn58	3	15	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.16	When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.	mn58	3	16	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:3.17	He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”	mn58	3	17	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Jain Ñātika, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	mn58	4	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.2	Then he looked up at the sun and thought,	mn58	4	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.3	“It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.	mn58	4	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.4	I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha,	mn58	4	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.5	“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”	mn58	4	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:4.6	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn58	4	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:5.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn58	5	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:5.2	Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.	mn58	5	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:5.3	Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn58	5	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:5.4	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,	mn58	5	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.1	and said to him,	mn58	6	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.2	“Sir, may the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?”	mn58	6	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.3	“This matter is not categorical, prince.”	mn58	6	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.4	“Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”	mn58	6	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.5	“But prince, why do you say that	mn58	6	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.6	the Jains have lost in this?”	mn58	6	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:6.7	Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened.	mn58	6	7	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.1	Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap.	mn58	7	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.2	Then the Buddha said to Abhaya,	mn58	7	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.3	“What do you think, prince?	mn58	7	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.4	If—because of your negligence or his nursemaid’s negligence—your boy were to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”	mn58	7	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.5	“I’d try to take it out, sir.	mn58	7	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.6	If that didn’t work, I’d cradle his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.	mn58	7	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.7	Why is that?	mn58	7	7	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:7.8	Because I have sympathy for the boy, sir.”	mn58	7	8	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.1	“In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, and which is disliked by others.	mn58	8	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.2	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful and disliked by others.	mn58	8	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.3	The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is disliked by others.	mn58	8	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.4	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and pointless, but which is liked by others.	mn58	8	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.5	The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and correct, but which is harmful, even if it is liked by others.	mn58	8	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.6	The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, and which is liked by others.	mn58	8	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.7	Why is that?	mn58	8	7	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:8.8	Because the Realized One has sympathy for sentient beings.”	mn58	8	8	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:9.1	“Sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned.	mn58	9	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:9.2	Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just strike you on the spot?”	mn58	9	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.1	“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn58	10	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.2	What do you think, prince?	mn58	10	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.3	Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”	mn58	10	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.4	“I am, sir.”	mn58	10	4	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.5	“What do you think, prince?	mn58	10	5	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.6	When they come to you and ask:	mn58	10	6	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.7	‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’	mn58	10	7	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.8	Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”	mn58	10	8	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.9	“Sir, I’m well-known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.	mn58	10	9	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.10	All the major and minor parts are well-known to me.	mn58	10	10	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:10.11	The answer just appears to me on the spot.”	mn58	10	11	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:11.1	“In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer just strikes me on the spot.	mn58	11	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:11.2	Why is that?	mn58	11	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:11.3	Because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that the answer just strikes him on the spot.”	mn58	11	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:12.1	When he had spoken, Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha,	mn58	12	1	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:12.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	mn58	12	2	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn58:12.3	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn58	12	3	mn	58	With Prince Abhaya
mn59:1.1	So I have heard.	mn59	1	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn59	1	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.3	Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn59	1	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.4	“Sir, how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of?”	mn59	1	4	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.5	“Chamberlain, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings:	mn59	1	5	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.6	pleasant, painful, and neutral.	mn59	1	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.7	The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”	mn59	1	7	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.8	When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	mn59	1	8	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.9	“Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings.	mn59	1	9	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.10	He’s spoken of two feelings:	mn59	1	10	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.11	pleasant and painful.	mn59	1	11	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:1.12	The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”	mn59	1	12	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.1	For a second time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,	mn59	2	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.2	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,	mn59	2	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.3	he’s spoken of three.”	mn59	2	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.6	For a second time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	mn59	2	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.7	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,	mn59	2	7	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:2.8	he’s spoken of two.”	mn59	2	8	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.1	And for a third time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,	mn59	3	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.2	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,	mn59	3	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.3	he’s spoken of three.”	mn59	3	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.6	And for a third time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,	mn59	3	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.7	“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,	mn59	3	7	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.8	he’s spoken of two.”	mn59	3	8	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:3.11	But neither was able to persuade the other.	mn59	3	11	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:4.1	Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga.	mn59	4	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:4.2	Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	mn59	4	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:4.3	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.	mn59	4	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:4.4	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	mn59	4	4	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.1	“Ānanda, the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī, which the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga didn’t agree with, was quite correct. But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī didn’t agree with, was also quite correct.	mn59	5	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.2	In one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings.	mn59	5	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.3	I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.	mn59	5	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.4	This being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	mn59	5	4	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.5	I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.	mn59	5	5	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:5.6	This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.	mn59	5	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.1	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn59	6	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.2	What five?	mn59	6	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn59	6	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.4	Sounds known by the ear …	mn59	6	4	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.5	Smells known by the nose …	mn59	6	5	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn59	6	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn59	6	7	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn59	6	8	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:6.9	The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.	mn59	6	9	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.1	There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.	mn59	7	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.2	Why is that?	mn59	7	2	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.3	Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.	mn59	7	3	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.4	And what is that pleasure?	mn59	7	4	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.5	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn59	7	5	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:7.6	This is a pleasure that is finer than that.	mn59	7	6	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:8.1	There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.	mn59	8	1	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling

mn59:16.7	That is what the Buddha said.	mn59	16	7	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn59:16.8	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn59	16	8	mn	59	The Many Kinds of Feeling
mn60:1.1	So I have heard.	mn60	1	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.	mn60	1	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard:	mn60	2	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn60	2	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn60	2	3	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn60	2	4	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn60	2	5	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn60	2	6	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn60	2	7	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:	mn60	3	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:4.1	“So, householders, is there any teacher you’re happy with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?”	mn60	4	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:4.2	“No, sir.”	mn60	4	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:4.3	“Since you haven’t found a teacher you’re happy with, you should undertake and implement this unfailing teaching.	mn60	4	3	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:4.4	For when the unfailing teaching is undertaken, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.	mn60	4	4	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:4.5	And what is the unfailing teaching?	mn60	4	5	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:5.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn60	5	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:5.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	mn60	5	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:6.1	And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this.	mn60	6	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:6.2	They say:	mn60	6	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:6.3	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously.

mn60:6.4	What do you think, householders?	mn60	6	4	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:6.5	Don’t these doctrines directly contradict each other?”	mn60	6	5	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:6.6	“Yes, sir.”	mn60	6	6	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:7.1	“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that	mn60	7	1	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:7.2	there’s no meaning in giving, etc.	mn60	7	2	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:7.3	You can expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn60	7	3	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:7.4	Why is that?	mn60	7	4	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:7.5	Because those ascetics and brahmins don’t see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.	mn60	7	5	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:8.1	Moreover, since there actually is another world, their view that there is no other world is wrong view.	mn60	8	1	mn	60	Unfailing

mn60:8.5	Since there actually is another world, in convincing another that there is no other world they are convincing them to accept an untrue teaching.	mn60	8	5	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:8.6	And on account of that they glorify themselves and put others down.	mn60	8	6	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:8.7	So they give up their former ethical conduct and are established in unethical conduct.	mn60	8	7	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:8.8	And that is how these many bad, unskillful qualities come to be with wrong view as condition—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and glorifying oneself and putting others down.	mn60	8	8	mn	60	Unfailing
mn60:9.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn60	9	1	mn	60	Unfailing

mn60:9.8	They have wrongly undertaken this unfailing teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of one side only, leaving out the skillful premise.	mn60	9	8	mn	60	Unfailing

mn63:1.1	So I have heard.	mn63	1	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn63	1	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.1	Then as Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	mn63	2	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.2	“There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared; he has set them aside and refused to comment on them.	mn63	2	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.3	For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.	mn63	2	3	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.4	The Buddha does not explain these points to me.	mn63	2	4	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.5	I don’t endorse that, and do not accept it.	mn63	2	5	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.6	I’ll go to him and ask him about this.	mn63	2	6	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.7	If he gives me a straight answer on any of these points,	mn63	2	7	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.10	I will lead the spiritual life under him.	mn63	2	10	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.11	If he does not explain these points to me,	mn63	2	11	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:2.14	I shall reject the training and return to a lesser life.”	mn63	2	14	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, Māluṅkyaputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts. He then continued:	mn63	3	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.17	“If the Buddha knows	mn63	3	17	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.18	that the cosmos is eternal, please tell me.	mn63	3	18	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.19	If you know	mn63	3	19	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.20	that the cosmos is not eternal, tell me.	mn63	3	20	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.21	If you don’t know	mn63	3	21	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.22	whether the cosmos is eternal or not, then it is straightforward to simply say:	mn63	3	22	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.23	‘I neither know nor see.’	mn63	3	23	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.24	If you know	mn63	3	24	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.25	that the cosmos is finite,	mn63	3	25	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.27	or infinite;	mn63	3	27	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.32	that the soul and the body are the same thing,	mn63	3	32	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.34	or they are different things;	mn63	3	34	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.39	that after death, a realized one still exists,	mn63	3	39	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.41	or no longer exists,	mn63	3	41	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.46	or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists, please tell me.	mn63	3	46	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.49	If you don’t know	mn63	3	49	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.50	any of these things, then it is straightforward to simply say:	mn63	3	50	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:3.51	‘I neither know nor see.’”	mn63	3	51	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.1	“What, Māluṅkyaputta, did I ever say to you:	mn63	4	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.2	‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you’?”	mn63	4	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.4	“No, sir.”	mn63	4	4	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.5	“Or did you ever say to me:	mn63	4	5	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.6	‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me’?”	mn63	4	6	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.8	“No, sir.”	mn63	4	8	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.9	“So it seems that I did not say to you:	mn63	4	9	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.10	‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you.’	mn63	4	10	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.13	And you never said to me:	mn63	4	13	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.14	‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me.’	mn63	4	14	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:4.17	In that case, you futile man, who are you and what are you rejecting?	mn63	4	17	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.1	Suppose someone were to say this:	mn63	5	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.2	‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me	mn63	5	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.3	that the cosmos is eternal, or that the cosmos is not eternal …	mn63	5	3	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.4	or that after death a realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists.’	mn63	5	4	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.5	That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that person would die.	mn63	5	5	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.6	Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.	mn63	5	6	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.7	His friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat him.	mn63	5	7	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.8	But the man would say:	mn63	5	8	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.9	‘I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.’	mn63	5	9	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.10	He’d say:	mn63	5	10	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.11	‘I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know the following things about the man who wounded me: his name and clan;	mn63	5	11	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:5.19	I won’t extract this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the bow that wounded me was straight or recurved;	mn63	5	19	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.21	whether the bow-string is made of swallow-wort fibre, sunn hemp fibre, sinew, sanseveria fibre, or spurge fibre;	mn63	5	21	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.23	whether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation tree;	mn63	5	23	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.25	whether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture, a heron, a hawk, a peacock, or a stork;	mn63	5	25	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.27	whether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow, a buffalo, a black lion, or an ape;	mn63	5	27	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.29	and whether the arrowhead was spiked, razor-tipped, barbed, made of iron or a calf’s tooth, or lancet-shaped.’	mn63	5	29	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.30	That man would still not have learned these things, and meanwhile they’d die.	mn63	5	30	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.31	In the same way, suppose someone was to say:	mn63	5	31	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.32	‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me	mn63	5	32	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:5.34	or that after death a realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists.’	mn63	5	34	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:5.35	That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that person would die.	mn63	5	35	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:6.1	It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.	mn63	6	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:6.2	It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is not eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.	mn63	6	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:6.4	And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate.	mn63	6	4	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:6.20	And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate.	mn63	6	20	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:7.1	So, Māluṅkyaputta, you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared,	mn63	7	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:7.2	and what I have declared as declared.	mn63	7	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:8.1	And why haven’t I declared these things?	mn63	8	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:8.2	Because they aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	mn63	8	2	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:8.3	That’s why I haven’t declared them.	mn63	8	3	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:9.1	And what have I declared?	mn63	9	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:9.7	‘this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’	mn63	9	7	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta
mn63:10.1	And why have I declared these things?	mn63	10	1	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn63:10.3	That’s why I have declared them.	mn63	10	3	mn	63	The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkyaputta

mn64:9.1	And what, Ānanda, is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters?	mn64	9	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.2	It’s when a mendicant—due to the seclusion from attachments, the giving up of unskillful qualities, and the complete settling of physical discomforts—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn64	9	2	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.3	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.	mn64	9	3	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.4	They turn their mind away from those things,	mn64	9	4	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.5	and apply it to the element free of death:	mn64	9	5	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.6	‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’	mn64	9	6	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.7	Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.	mn64	9	7	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.8	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.	mn64	9	8	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:9.9	This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	mn64	9	9	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:10-12.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …	mn64	10-12	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:10-12.2	third absorption …	mn64	10-12	2	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:10-12.3	fourth absorption.	mn64	10-12	3	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya

mn64:10-12.7	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	mn64	10-12	7	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.	mn64	13	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya

mn64:13.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	mn64	13	5	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.	mn64	14	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:14.2	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	mn64	14	2	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:14.3	They turn their mind away from those things …	mn64	14	3	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya

mn64:14.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.	mn64	14	5	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:15.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.	mn64	15	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:15.2	They contemplate the phenomena there—included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent …	mn64	15	2	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya

mn64:15.4	If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.	mn64	15	4	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:15.5	This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.”	mn64	15	5	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:16.1	“Sir, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, how come some mendicants here are released in heart while others are released by wisdom?”	mn64	16	1	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:16.2	“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their faculties.”	mn64	16	2	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:16.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn64	16	3	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn64:16.4	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn64	16	4	mn	64	The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
mn65:1.1	So I have heard.	mn65	1	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn65	1	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn65	1	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn65	1	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn65	1	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn65	1	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:2.1	“Mendicants, I eat my food in one sitting per day.	mn65	2	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:2.2	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn65	2	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:2.3	You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.	mn65	2	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:2.4	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	mn65	2	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,	mn65	3	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:3.2	“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat my food in one sitting per day.	mn65	3	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:3.3	For when eating once a day I might feel remorse and regret.”	mn65	3	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.1	“Well then, Bhaddāli, eat one part of the meal in the place where you’re invited, and bring the rest back to eat.	mn65	4	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.2	Eating this way, too, you will sustain yourself.”	mn65	4	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.3	“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat that way, either.	mn65	4	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.4	For when eating that way I might also feel remorse and regret.”	mn65	4	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.5	Then, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, Bhaddāli announced he would not try to keep it.	mn65	4	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:4.6	Then for the whole of that three months Bhaddāli would not see the Buddha face to face, as happens when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	4	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:5.1	At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that	mn65	5	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:5.2	when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.	mn65	5	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:6.1	Then Bhaddāli went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them.	mn65	6	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The mendicants said to Bhaddāli,	mn65	6	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:6.3	“Reverend Bhaddāli, this robe is being made for the Buddha.	mn65	6	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:6.4	When it’s finished and the three months of the rains residence have passed the Buddha will set out wandering.	mn65	6	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:6.5	Come on, Bhaddāli, learn your lesson. Don’t make it hard for yourself later on.”	mn65	6	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:7.1	“Yes, reverends,” Bhaddāli replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn65	7	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:7.2	“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.	mn65	7	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:7.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	mn65	7	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:8.1	“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.	mn65	8	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:9.1	And you didn’t realize this situation:	mn65	9	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:9.2	‘The Buddha is staying in Sāvatthī, and he’ll know me	mn65	9	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli

mn65:9.24	You also didn’t realize this situation.”	mn65	9	24	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:10.1	“I made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.	mn65	10	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:10.2	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	mn65	10	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:10.3	“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.	mn65	10	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.1	What do you think, Bhaddāli?	mn65	11	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.2	Suppose I was to say this to a mendicant who is freed both ways:	mn65	11	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.3	‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”	mn65	11	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.4	“No, sir.”	mn65	11	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.5	“What do you think, Bhaddāli?	mn65	11	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.6	Suppose I was to say the same thing to a mendicant who is freed by wisdom,	mn65	11	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.7	or a direct witness,	mn65	11	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.8	or attained to view,	mn65	11	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.9	or freed by faith,	mn65	11	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.10	or a follower of teachings,	mn65	11	10	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.11	or a follower by faith:	mn65	11	11	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.12	‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”	mn65	11	12	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:11.13	“No, sir.”	mn65	11	13	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:12.1	“What do you think, Bhaddāli?	mn65	12	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:12.2	At that time were you freed both ways, freed by wisdom, a direct witness, attained to view, freed by faith, a follower of teachings, or a follower by faith?”	mn65	12	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:12.3	“No, sir.”	mn65	12	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:12.4	“Weren’t you vacuous, hollow, and mistaken?”	mn65	12	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.1	“Yes, sir.	mn65	13	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.2	I made a mistake …	mn65	13	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.3	Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”	mn65	13	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.4	“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. …	mn65	13	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.5	But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.	mn65	13	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:13.6	For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.	mn65	13	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.1	Bhaddāli, take a mendicant who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	14	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.2	They think,	mn65	14	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.3	‘Why don’t I frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn65	14	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.4	Hopefully I’ll realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.’	mn65	14	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.5	So they frequent a secluded lodging.	mn65	14	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.6	While they’re living withdrawn, they’re reprimanded by the Teacher, by sensible spiritual companions after examination, by deities, and by themselves.	mn65	14	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.7	Being reprimanded in this way, they don’t realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn65	14	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.8	Why is that?	mn65	14	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:14.9	Because that’s how it is when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	14	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.1	But take a mendicant who does fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	15	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.2	They think,	mn65	15	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.3	‘Why don’t I frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn65	15	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.4	Hopefully I’ll realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.’	mn65	15	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.5	They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn65	15	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.6	While they’re living withdrawn, they’re not reprimanded by the Teacher, by sensible spiritual companions after examination, by deities, or by themselves.	mn65	15	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:15.7	Not being reprimanded in this way, they realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn65	15	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:16.1	Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn65	16	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:16.2	Why is that?	mn65	16	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:16.3	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	16	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn65	17	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.2	Why is that?	mn65	17	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.3	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	17	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.4	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn65	17	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.5	Why is that?	mn65	17	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.6	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	17	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.7	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn65	17	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.8	Why is that?	mn65	17	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:17.9	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	17	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:18.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn65	18	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:18.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn65	18	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:18.3	Why is that?	mn65	18	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:18.4	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	18	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:19.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn65	19	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:19.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. … They’re reborn in the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. … they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman … they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn65	19	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:19.3	Why is that?	mn65	19	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:19.4	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.	mn65	19	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:20.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn65	20	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:20.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn65	20	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:20.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn65	20	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:21.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn65	21	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:21.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn65	21	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:21.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn65	21	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:21.4	Why is that?	mn65	21	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:21.5	Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.”	mn65	21	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:22.1	When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,	mn65	22	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:22.2	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why they punish some monk, repeatedly pressuring him?	mn65	22	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:22.3	And what is the cause, what is the reason why they don’t similarly punish another monk, repeatedly pressuring him?”	mn65	22	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.1	“Take a monk who is a frequent offender with many offenses.	mn65	23	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.2	When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He doesn’t proceed properly, he doesn’t fall in line, he doesn’t proceed to get past it, and he doesn’t say: ‘I’ll do what pleases the Saṅgha.’	mn65	23	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.3	In such a case, the monks say:	mn65	23	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.4	‘Reverends, this monk is a frequent offender, with many offenses.	mn65	23	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.5	When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He doesn’t proceed properly, he doesn’t fall in line, he doesn’t proceed to get past it, and he doesn’t say: “I’ll do what pleases the Saṅgha.”	mn65	23	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.6	It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settled.’	mn65	23	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:23.7	And that’s what they do.	mn65	23	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:24.1	Take some other monk who is a frequent offender with many offenses.	mn65	24	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:24.2	When admonished by the monks, he doesn’t dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He doesn’t display annoyance, hate, and bitterness.

mn65:24.6	It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is quickly settled.’	mn65	24	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:24.7	And that’s what they do.	mn65	24	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:25.1	Take some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offenses.	mn65	25	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:25.2	When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue …	mn65	25	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli

mn65:25.7	And that’s what they do.	mn65	25	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:26.1	Take some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offenses.	mn65	26	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:26.2	When admonished by the monks, he doesn’t dodge the issue …	mn65	26	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli

mn65:26.7	And that’s what they do.	mn65	26	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:27.1	Take some other monk who gets by with mere faith and love.	mn65	27	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:27.2	In such a case, the monks say:	mn65	27	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:27.3	‘Reverends, this monk gets by with mere faith and love.	mn65	27	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:27.4	Suppose we punish him, repeatedly pressuring him—	mn65	27	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:27.5	no, let him not lose what little faith and love he has!’	mn65	27	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli

mn65:28.2	‘Let them not lose the one eye that they have!’	mn65	28	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:28.3	In the same way, some monk gets by with mere faith and love.	mn65	28	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli

mn65:28.7	no, let him not lose what little faith and love he has!’	mn65	28	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:28.8	This is the cause, this is the reason why they punish some monk, repeatedly pressuring him.	mn65	28	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:28.9	And this is the cause, this is the reason why they don’t similarly punish another monk, repeatedly pressuring him.”	mn65	28	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:29.1	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants?	mn65	29	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:29.2	And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?”	mn65	29	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:30.1	“That’s how it is, Bhaddāli. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants.	mn65	30	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:30.2	The Teacher does not lay down training rules for disciples as long as certain defiling influences have not appeared in the Saṅgha.	mn65	30	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:30.3	But when such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha, the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against them.	mn65	30	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:31.1	And they don’t appear until the Saṅgha has attained a great size,	mn65	31	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:31.4	an abundance of material support and fame, learning, and seniority.	mn65	31	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:31.5	But when the Saṅgha has attained these things, then such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha, and the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against them.	mn65	31	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.1	There were only a few of you there at the time when I taught the exposition on the simile of the thoroughbred colt.	mn65	32	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.2	Do you remember that, Bhaddāli?”	mn65	32	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.3	“No, sir.”	mn65	32	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.4	“What do you believe the reason for that is?”	mn65	32	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.5	“Sir, it’s surely because for a long time now I haven’t fulfilled the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.”	mn65	32	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.6	“That’s not the only reason, Bhaddāli.	mn65	32	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.7	Rather, for a long time I have comprehended your mind and known:	mn65	32	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.8	‘While I’m teaching, this futile man doesn’t pay attention, apply the mind, concentrate wholeheartedly, or actively listen to the teaching.’	mn65	32	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.9	Still, Bhaddāli, I shall teach the exposition on the simile of the thoroughbred colt.	mn65	32	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.10	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn65	32	10	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.11	“Yes, sir,” Bhaddāli replied.	mn65	32	11	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:32.12	The Buddha said this:	mn65	32	12	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.1	“Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.	mn65	33	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.2	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	mn65	33	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.3	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	mn65	33	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.4	When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to wearing the harness.	mn65	33	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.5	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	mn65	33	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.6	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	mn65	33	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.7	When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to walking in procession, circling, prancing, galloping, charging, the protocols and traditions of court, and in the very best speed, fleetness, and camaraderie.	mn65	33	7	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.8	Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some twists, ducks, and dodges.	mn65	33	8	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.9	But with regular and gradual practice its bad behavior is extinguished.	mn65	33	9	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.10	When it has done this, the horse trainer next rewards it with a grooming and a rub down.	mn65	33	10	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:33.11	A fine royal thoroughbred with these ten factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.	mn65	33	11	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.1	In the same way, a mendicant with ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.	mn65	34	1	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.2	What ten?	mn65	34	2	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.3	It’s when a mendicant has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom.	mn65	34	3	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.4	A mendicant with these ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”	mn65	34	4	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn65	34	5	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn65:34.6	Satisfied, Venerable Bhaddāli approved what the Buddha said.	mn65	34	6	mn	65	With Bhaddāli
mn66:1.1	So I have heard.	mn66	1	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	mn66	1	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	mn66	2	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:2.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	mn66	2	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	mn66	2	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:3.1	Venerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.	mn66	3	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:3.2	He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to that forest grove for the day’s meditation.	mn66	3	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:3.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	mn66	3	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:3.4	Then as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	mn66	3	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:4.1	“The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!	mn66	4	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:4.2	He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!”	mn66	4	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:5.1	Then in the late afternoon, Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	mn66	5	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.1	“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:	mn66	6	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.2	‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!	mn66	6	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.3	He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’	mn66	6	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.4	For we used to eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	mn66	6	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.5	But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,	mn66	6	5	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.6	‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of day.’	mn66	6	6	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.7	At that, sir, we became sad and upset,	mn66	6	7	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.8	‘But these faithful householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time of day. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’	mn66	6	8	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.9	But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of day.	mn66	6	9	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.10	Then we ate in the evening and the morning.	mn66	6	10	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.11	But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,	mn66	6	11	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.12	‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of night.’	mn66	6	12	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.13	At that, sir, we became sad and upset,	mn66	6	13	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.14	‘But that’s considered the more delicious of the two meals. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’	mn66	6	14	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.15	Once it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day. He said,	mn66	6	15	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.16	‘Come, let’s set this aside; we’ll enjoy it together this evening.’	mn66	6	16	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.17	Nearly all meals are prepared at night, only a few in the day.	mn66	6	17	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.18	But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of night.	mn66	6	18	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.19	In the past, mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night. They walked into a swamp, or fell into a sewer, or collided with a thorn bush, or collided with a sleeping cow, or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, or were invited by a female to commit a lewd act.	mn66	6	19	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.20	Once it so happened that I was wandering for alms in the dark of the night.	mn66	6	20	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.21	A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning.	mn66	6	21	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.22	Startled, she cried out,	mn66	6	22	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.23	‘Woe is me! It’s a damn goblin!’	mn66	6	23	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.24	When she said this, I said to her,	mn66	6	24	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.25	‘Sister, I am no goblin.	mn66	6	25	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.26	I’m a mendicant waiting for alms.’	mn66	6	26	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.27	‘Die, mendicant’s father! Die, mendicant’s mother!	mn66	6	27	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.28	Better to have your belly sliced open with a sharp meat cleaver than to wander for alms in the dark of night for the sake of your belly!’	mn66	6	28	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.29	Recollecting that, I thought,	mn66	6	29	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.30	‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!	mn66	6	30	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:6.31	He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’”	mn66	6	31	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:7.1	“This is exactly what happens when some silly people are told by me to give something up. They say,	mn66	7	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:7.2	‘What, such a trivial, insignificant thing as this? This ascetic is much too strict!’	mn66	7	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:7.3	They don’t give it up, and they nurse bitterness towards me;	mn66	7	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:7.4	and for the mendicants who want to train, that becomes a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.	mn66	7	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:8.1	Suppose a quail was tied with a vine, and was waiting there to be injured, caged, or killed.	mn66	8	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:8.2	Would it be right to say that,	mn66	8	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:8.3	for that quail, that vine is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial?”	mn66	8	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:8.5	“No, sir.	mn66	8	5	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:9.1	But when some gentlemen are told by me to give something up, they say,	mn66	9	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:9.2	‘What, we just have to give up such a trivial, insignificant thing as this, when the Blessed One tells us to give it up, the Holy One tells us to let it go?’	mn66	9	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:9.3	They give it up, and they don’t nurse bitterness towards me;	mn66	9	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:9.4	and when the mendicants who want to train have given that up, they live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.	mn66	9	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:9.5	For them, that bond is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial.	mn66	9	5	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:10.1	Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. And it was bound with a strong harness. But just by twisting its body a little, it would break apart its bonds and go wherever it wants.	mn66	10	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:10.2	Would it be right to say that,	mn66	10	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:14.1	Take a certain person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.	mn66	14	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:18.2	What five?	mn66	18	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:18.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn66	18	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:20.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …	mn66	20	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:21.1	This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening. Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.	mn66	21	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:24.2	This belongs to the perturbable.	mn66	24	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:24.3	And what there belongs to the perturbable?	mn66	24	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:24.4	Whatever bliss with equanimity has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable.	mn66	24	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:25.1	Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, enters and remains in the fourth absorption.	mn66	25	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:25.2	This belongs to the imperturbable, I say.	mn66	25	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:26.1	Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.	mn66	26	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:26.2	But this is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	26	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:26.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	26	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:27.1	Take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption. That goes beyond it.	mn66	27	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:27.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	27	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:27.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	27	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:28.1	Take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in the third absorption. That goes beyond it.	mn66	28	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:28.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	28	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:29.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	29	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:29.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	29	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:30.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. That goes beyond it.	mn66	30	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:30.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	30	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:30.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	30	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:31.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. That goes beyond it.	mn66	31	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:31.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	31	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:31.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	31	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:32.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. That goes beyond it.	mn66	32	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail

mn66:32.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	32	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:33.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That goes beyond it.	mn66	33	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:33.2	But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.	mn66	33	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:33.3	And what goes beyond it?	mn66	33	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.1	Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. That goes beyond it.	mn66	34	1	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.2	So, Udāyī, I even recommend giving up the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn66	34	2	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.3	Do you see any fetter, large or small, that I don’t recommend giving up?”	mn66	34	3	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.4	“No, sir.”	mn66	34	4	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn66	34	5	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn66:34.6	Satisfied, Venerable Udāyī approved what the Buddha said.	mn66	34	6	mn	66	The Simile of the Quail
mn67:1.1	So I have heard.	mn67	1	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cātumā in a myrobalan grove.	mn67	1	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:2.1	Now at that time five hundred mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Cātumā to see the Buddha.	mn67	2	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:2.2	And the visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.	mn67	2	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:3.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn67	3	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:3.2	“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	mn67	3	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:3.3	And Ānanda told him what had happened.	mn67	3	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.1	“Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that	mn67	4	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.2	the teacher summons them.”	mn67	4	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said,	mn67	4	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.4	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	mn67	4	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.5	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:	mn67	4	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.6	“Mendicants, what’s with that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	mn67	4	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:4.7	And they told him what had happened.	mn67	4	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:5.1	“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”	mn67	5	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:5.2	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.	mn67	5	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.1	Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā were sitting together at the town hall on some business.	mn67	6	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.2	Seeing those mendicants coming off in the distance,	mn67	6	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.3	they went up to them and said,	mn67	6	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.4	“Hello venerables, where are you going?”	mn67	6	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.5	“Good sirs, the mendicant Saṅgha has been dismissed by the Buddha.”	mn67	6	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.6	“Well then, venerables, sit here for an hour. Hopefully we’ll be able to restore the Buddha’s confidence.”	mn67	6	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:6.7	“Yes, good sirs,” replied the mendicants.	mn67	6	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.1	Then the Sakyans of Cātumā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	mn67	7	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.2	“May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	7	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.3	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	7	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.4	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!	mn67	7	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.5	There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.	mn67	7	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.6	If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	mn67	7	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.7	If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.	mn67	7	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.8	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	mn67	7	8	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.9	If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.	mn67	7	9	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.10	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	mn67	7	10	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.11	May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	7	11	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.12	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	7	12	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:7.13	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”	mn67	7	13	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:8.1	Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha.	mn67	8	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:8.2	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	mn67	8	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.1	“May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	9	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.2	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	9	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.3	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!	mn67	9	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.4	There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	mn67	9	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.5	If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. …	mn67	9	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.7	If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.	mn67	9	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.8	In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.	mn67	9	8	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.9	May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	9	9	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.10	May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!	mn67	9	10	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:9.11	May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”	mn67	9	11	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:10.1	The Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati were able to restore the Buddha’s confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.	mn67	10	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:11.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants,	mn67	11	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:11.2	“Get up, reverends, and pick up your bowls and robes.	mn67	11	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:11.3	The Buddha’s confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Cātumā and the divinity Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.”	mn67	11	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,	mn67	12	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.2	“Sāriputta, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”	mn67	12	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.3	“Sir, I thought this:	mn67	12	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.4	‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn67	12	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.5	Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life, and so will we.’”	mn67	12	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:12.6	“Hold on, Sāriputta, hold on! Don’t you ever think such a thing again!”	mn67	12	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.1	Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,	mn67	13	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.2	“Moggallāna, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”	mn67	13	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.3	“Sir, I thought this:	mn67	13	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.4	‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn67	13	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.5	Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life. Meanwhile, Venerable Sāriputta and I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’”	mn67	13	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.6	“Good, good, Moggallāna!	mn67	13	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:13.7	For either I should lead the mendicant Saṅgha, or else Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”	mn67	13	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:14.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:	mn67	14	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:14.2	“Mendicants, when you go into the water you should anticipate four dangers.	mn67	14	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:14.3	What four?	mn67	14	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:14.4	The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and sharks.	mn67	14	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:14.5	These are the four dangers that you should anticipate when you go into the water.	mn67	14	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:15.1	In the same way, a person gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four dangers.	mn67	15	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:15.2	What four?	mn67	15	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:15.3	The dangers of waves, gharials, whirlpools, and sharks.	mn67	15	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of waves?	mn67	16	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	mn67	16	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.3	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	mn67	16	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.4	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	mn67	16	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.5	When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:	mn67	16	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.6	‘You should go out like this, and come back like that. You should look to the front like this, and to the side like that. You should contract your limbs like this, and extend them like that. This is how you should bear your outer robe, bowl, and robes.’	mn67	16	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.7	They think:	mn67	16	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.8	‘Formerly, as laypeople, we advised and instructed others.	mn67	16	8	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.9	And now these mendicants—who you’d think were our children or grandchildren—imagine they can advise and instruct us!’	mn67	16	9	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.10	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.	mn67	16	10	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.11	This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life for fear of the danger of waves.	mn67	16	11	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:16.12	‘Danger of waves’ is a term for anger and distress.	mn67	16	12	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of gharials?	mn67	17	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	mn67	17	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.3	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	mn67	17	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.4	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	mn67	17	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.5	When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:	mn67	17	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.6	‘You may eat, consume, taste, and drink these things, but not those. You may eat what’s allowable, but not what’s unallowable. You may eat at the right time, but not at the wrong time.’	mn67	17	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.7	They think: ‘Formerly, as laypeople, we used to eat, consume, taste, and drink what we wanted, not what we didn’t want.	mn67	17	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.8	We ate and drank both allowable and unallowable things, at the right time and the wrong time.	mn67	17	8	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.9	And these faithful householders give us delicious fresh and cooked foods at the wrong time of day. But these guys imagine they can gag our mouths!’	mn67	17	9	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.10	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.	mn67	17	10	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.11	This is called one who rejects the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of gharials.	mn67	17	11	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:17.12	‘Danger of gharials’ is a term for gluttony.	mn67	17	12	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.1	And what, mendicants, is the danger of whirlpools?	mn67	18	1	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.2	It’s when a gentleman has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:	mn67	18	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.3	‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	mn67	18	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.4	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	mn67	18	4	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.5	When they’ve gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.	mn67	18	5	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.6	There they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn67	18	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.7	They think:	mn67	18	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.8	‘Formerly, as laypeople, we amused ourselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn67	18	8	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.9	And it’s true that my family is wealthy.	mn67	18	9	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.10	I can both enjoy my wealth and make merit.’	mn67	18	10	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.11	They resign the training and return to a lesser life.	mn67	18	11	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.12	This is called one who rejects the training and returns to a lesser life for fear of the danger of whirlpools.	mn67	18	12	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:18.13	‘Danger of whirlpools’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn67	18	13	mn	67	At Cātumā

mn67:19.6	There they see a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.	mn67	19	6	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:19.7	Lust infects their mind,	mn67	19	7	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:19.8	so they resign the training and return to a lesser life.	mn67	19	8	mn	67	At Cātumā

mn67:20.2	That is what the Buddha said.	mn67	20	2	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn67:20.3	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn67	20	3	mn	67	At Cātumā
mn68:1.1	So I have heard.	mn68	1	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the grove of flame-of-the-forest trees.	mn68	1	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name—	mn68	2	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:2.2	The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.	mn68	2	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.1	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn68	3	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.2	Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:	mn68	3	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.3	“Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in my name—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”	mn68	3	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.4	When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.	mn68	3	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.5	For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.	mn68	3	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:3.10	For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.	mn68	3	10	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:4.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn68	4	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:4.2	“Why don’t I question just those gentlemen?”	mn68	4	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:4.3	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha,	mn68	4	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:4.4	“Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”	mn68	4	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:4.5	“Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”	mn68	4	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	mn68	5	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.2	It’s appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.	mn68	5	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.3	Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, with pristine black hair, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn68	5	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.4	But you didn’t go forth to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.	mn68	5	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.5	Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	mn68	5	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.6	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”	mn68	5	6	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:5.8	“Yes, sir.”	mn68	5	8	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:6.1	“But, Anuruddha and friends, when a gentleman has gone forth like this, what should he do?	mn68	6	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:6.2	Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.	mn68	6	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:6.3	That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.	mn68	6	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:6.4	Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.	mn68	6	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:6.5	That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.	mn68	6	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.1	Is this what you think of me?	mn68	7	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.2	‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn68	7	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.3	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”	mn68	7	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.4	“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.	mn68	7	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.7	We think of you this way:	mn68	7	7	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.8	‘The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn68	7	8	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.9	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.’”	mn68	7	9	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.10	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	mn68	7	10	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.11	The Realized One has given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.	mn68	7	11	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.12	Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,	mn68	7	12	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.13	in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.	mn68	7	13	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:7.14	That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and dispels some things.	mn68	7	14	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:8.1	What do you think, Anuruddha and friends?	mn68	8	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:8.2	What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away:	mn68	8	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:8.3	‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”	mn68	8	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:8.4	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn68	8	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:9.1	“The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’	mn68	9	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:9.3	Rather, there are gentlemen of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness.	mn68	9	3	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:9.4	When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.	mn68	9	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:9.5	That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.	mn68	9	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.1	Take a monk who hears this:	mn68	10	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.2	‘The monk named so-and-so has passed away.	mn68	10	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:10.4	he was enlightened.’	mn68	10	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.5	And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable	mn68	10	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.6	had such ethics, such qualities, such wisdom, such meditation, or such freedom.	mn68	10	6	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.7	Recollecting that monk’s faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom, he applies his mind to that end.	mn68	10	7	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:10.8	That’s how a monk lives at ease.	mn68	10	8	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:11.1	Take a monk who hears this:	mn68	11	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:11.2	‘The monk named so-and-so has passed away.	mn68	11	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:11.4	with the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’	mn68	11	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:11.5	And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable	mn68	11	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:12.4	with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, he’s a once-returner. He’ll come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’	mn68	12	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:12.5	And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable	mn68	12	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:13.1	Take a monk who hears this:	mn68	13	1	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:13.2	‘The monk named so-and-so has passed away.	mn68	13	2	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:13.4	with the ending of three fetters he’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’	mn68	13	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:13.5	And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable	mn68	13	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna

mn68:24.4	When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.	mn68	24	4	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:24.5	That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn68	24	5	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:24.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn68	24	6	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn68:24.7	Satisfied, Venerable Anuruddha approved what the Buddha said.	mn68	24	7	mn	68	At Naḷakapāna
mn69:1.1	So I have heard.	mn69	1	1	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn69	1	2	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:2.1	Now at that time a wilderness mendicant of boorish behavior named Gulissāni had come down to the midst of the Saṅgha on some business.	mn69	2	1	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:2.2	There Venerable Sāriputta spoke to the mendicants about Gulissāni:	mn69	2	2	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:3.1	“Reverends, a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should have respect and reverence for his spiritual companions.	mn69	3	1	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:3.2	If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:	mn69	3	2	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn69:3.3	‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he has no respect and reverence for his spiritual companions?’	mn69	3	3	mn	69	With Gulissāni

mn69:4.3	If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:	mn69	4	3	mn	69	With Gulissāni

mn69:19.9	“Reverend Moggallāna, these things should be undertaken and followed by wilderness monks, and still more by those who live within a village.”	mn69	19	9	mn	69	With Gulissāni
mn70:1.1	So I have heard.	mn70	1	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsis together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn70	1	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	mn70	1	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:2.1	“Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night.	mn70	2	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:2.2	Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn70	2	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:2.3	You too should abstain from eating at night.	mn70	2	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:2.4	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	mn70	2	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn70	2	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:3.1	Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsis, arrived at a town of the Kāsis named Kīṭāgiri,	mn70	3	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:3.2	and stayed there.	mn70	3	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.1	Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.	mn70	4	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.2	Then several mendicants went up to them and said,	mn70	4	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.3	“Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn70	4	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.4	Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn70	4	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.5	You too should abstain from eating at night.	mn70	4	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.6	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	mn70	4	6	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.7	When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them,	mn70	4	7	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.8	“Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	mn70	4	8	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.9	Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn70	4	9	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.10	Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?	mn70	4	10	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:4.11	We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.”	mn70	4	11	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:5.1	Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	mn70	5	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	mn70	6	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka that	mn70	6	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.3	the teacher summons them.”	mn70	6	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants and said,	mn70	6	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.5	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	mn70	6	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.6	“Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	mn70	6	6	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.7	The Buddha said to them, “Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said:	mn70	6	7	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.8	‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn70	6	8	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.9	Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn70	6	9	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.10	You too should abstain from eating at night.	mn70	6	10	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.11	Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’	mn70	6	11	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.12	When they said this, did you really say to them:	mn70	6	12	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.13	‘Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.	mn70	6	13	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.14	Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn70	6	14	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.15	Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?	mn70	6	15	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.16	We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.’”	mn70	6	16	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.17	“Yes, sir.”	mn70	6	17	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.18	“Mendicants, have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: no matter what this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—their unskillful qualities decline and their skillful qualities grow?”	mn70	6	18	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:6.19	“No, sir.”	mn70	6	19	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:7.1	“Haven’t you known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.

mn70:7.2	“Yes, sir.”	mn70	7	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:8.1	“Good, mendicants!	mn70	8	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:10.4	“No, sir.”	mn70	10	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:10.6	‘When someone feels this kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.’ Since this is so, that’s why I say: ‘You should give up this kind of neutral feeling.’	mn70	10	6	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:10.7	Now, suppose I hadn’t known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:	mn70	10	7	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:12.1	Mendicants, I don’t say that all these mendicants still have work to do with diligence.	mn70	12	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:12.2	Nor do I say that all these mendicants have no work to do with diligence.	mn70	12	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:12.3	I say that mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and become rightly freed through enlightenment.	mn70	12	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:12.4	Why is that?	mn70	12	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:12.5	They’ve done their work with diligence.	mn70	12	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:12.6	They’re incapable of being negligent.	mn70	12	6	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:13.1	I say that mendicants still have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn70	13	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:13.2	Why is that? Thinking:	mn70	13	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:13.3	‘Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their faculties.	mn70	13	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:13.5	Seeing this fruit of diligence for those mendicants, I say that they still have work to do with diligence.	mn70	13	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:14.1	Mendicants, these seven people are found in the world.	mn70	14	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:14.2	What seven?	mn70	14	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:14.3	One freed both ways, one freed by wisdom, a direct witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of teachings, and a follower by faith.	mn70	14	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:15.1	And what person is freed both ways?	mn70	15	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:15.2	It’s a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements have come to an end.	mn70	15	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:15.3	This person is called freed both ways.	mn70	15	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:22.1	Mendicants, I don’t say that enlightenment is achieved right away.	mn70	22	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:22.2	Rather, enlightenment is achieved by gradual training, progress, and practice.	mn70	22	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:23.1	And how is enlightenment achieved by gradual training, progress, and practice?	mn70	23	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:23.2	It’s when someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher. They pay homage, actively listen, hear the teachings, remember the teachings, reflect on their meaning, and accept them after deliberation. Then enthusiasm springs up; they make an effort, weigh up, and persevere. Persevering, they directly realize the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom.	mn70	23	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.1	Mendicants, there has not been that faith,	mn70	24	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri

mn70:24.9	that enthusiasm,	mn70	24	9	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.10	that making an effort,	mn70	24	10	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.11	that weighing up,	mn70	24	11	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.12	or that striving.	mn70	24	12	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.13	You’re on a bad path, mendicants! You’re practicing the wrong way!	mn70	24	13	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:24.14	How far these futile men have strayed from this teaching and training!	mn70	24	14	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:25.1	There is an exposition in four statements, which a sensible person would quickly understand when it is recited.	mn70	25	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:25.2	I shall recite it for you, mendicants. Try to understand it.”	mn70	25	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:25.3	“Sir, who are we next to those who understand the teaching?”	mn70	25	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:26.1	“Even with a teacher who values things of the flesh, is an heir in things of the flesh, who lives caught up in things of the flesh, you wouldn’t get into such haggling:	mn70	26	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:26.2	‘If we get this, we’ll do that. If we don’t get this, we won’t do it.’ What then of the Realized One, who lives utterly detached from things of the flesh?	mn70	26	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.1	For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, this is in line with the teaching:	mn70	27	1	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.2	‘The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple.	mn70	27	2	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.3	The Buddha knows, I do not know.’	mn70	27	3	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.4	For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, the Teacher’s instructions are nourishing and nutritious.	mn70	27	4	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.5	For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, this is in line with the teaching:	mn70	27	5	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.6	‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not relax my energy until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’	mn70	27	6	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.7	For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, one of two results can be expected:	mn70	27	7	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.8	enlightenment in this very life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”	mn70	27	8	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.9	That is what the Buddha said.	mn70	27	9	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn70:27.10	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn70	27	10	mn	70	At Kīṭāgiri
mn71:1.1	So I have heard.	mn71	1	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	mn71	1	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:2.1	Now at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta was residing in the Single Lotus Monastery of the wanderers.	mn71	2	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	mn71	3	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	mn71	3	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Vesālī.	mn71	3	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:3.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Vacchagotta at the Single Lotus Monastery?”	mn71	3	4	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:3.5	So that’s what he did.	mn71	3	5	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.1	Vacchagotta saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn71	4	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.2	and said to him,	mn71	4	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	mn71	4	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	mn71	4	4	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn71	4	5	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	mn71	4	6	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.7	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	mn71	4	7	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.8	while Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn71	4	8	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:4.9	Then Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:	mn71	4	9	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:5.1	“Sir, I have heard this:	mn71	5	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:5.2	‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	mn71	5	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:5.3	“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”’	mn71	5	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:5.4	I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	mn71	5	4	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:5.5	“Vaccha, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”	mn71	5	5	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:6.1	“So how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	mn71	6	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:6.2	“‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.	mn71	6	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:7.1	For, Vaccha, whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives.	mn71	7	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:7.2	That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn71	7	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:8.1	And whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn71	8	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:9.1	And I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.	mn71	9	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:10.1	‘The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges.’ Answering like this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.”	mn71	10	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:11.1	When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha,	mn71	11	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:11.2	“Worthy Gotama, are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”	mn71	11	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:11.3	“No, Vaccha.”	mn71	11	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:12.1	“But are there any laypeople who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up?”	mn71	12	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:12.2	“There’s not just one hundred laypeople, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that who, without giving up the fetter of lay life, go to heaven when the body breaks up.”	mn71	12	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:13.1	“Worthy Gotama, are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks up?”	mn71	13	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges

mn71:14.1	“But are there any Ājīvaka ascetics who go to heaven when the body breaks up?”	mn71	14	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:14.2	“Vaccha, when I recollect the past ninety-one eons, I can’t find any Ājīvaka ascetics who have gone to heaven, except one;	mn71	14	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:14.3	and he taught the efficacy of deeds and action.”	mn71	14	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:15.1	“In that case, worthy Gotama, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”	mn71	15	1	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:15.2	“Yes, Vaccha, that sectarian fold is empty even of the chance to go to heaven.”	mn71	15	2	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn71	15	3	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn71:15.4	Satisfied, the wanderer Vacchagotta approved what the Buddha said.	mn71	15	4	mn	71	To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
mn72:1.1	So I have heard.	mn72	1	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn72	1	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:2.1	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn72	2	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn72	2	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:3.1	“Worthy Gotama, is this your view: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	3	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:3.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	3	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:4.1	“Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	4	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:4.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	4	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:5.1	“Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is finite. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	5	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:5.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	5	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:6.1	“Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is infinite. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	6	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:6.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	6	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:7.1	“Then is this your view: ‘The soul and the body are the same thing. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	7	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:7.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	7	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:8.1	“Then is this your view: ‘The soul and the body are different things. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	8	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:8.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	8	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:9.1	“Then is this your view: ‘A realized one still exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	9	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:9.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	9	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:10.1	“Then is this your view: ‘A realized one no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	10	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:10.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	10	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:11.1	“Then is this your view: ‘A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	11	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:11.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	11	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:12.1	“Then is this your view: ‘A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn72	12	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:12.3	“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”	mn72	12	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:13.1	“Worthy Gotama, when asked these ten questions, you say: ‘That’s not my view.’	mn72	13	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:13.31	Seeing what drawback do you avoid all these convictions?”	mn72	13	31	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:14.1	“Each of these ten convictions is the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views. They’re beset with suffering, distress, anguish, and fever. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	mn72	14	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:14.11	Seeing this drawback I avoid all these convictions.”	mn72	14	11	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.1	“But does the worthy Gotama have any convictions at all?”	mn72	15	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.2	“A realized one has done away with convictions.	mn72	15	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.3	For a realized one has seen:	mn72	15	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.4	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	mn72	15	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.5	Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.	mn72	15	5	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.6	Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.	mn72	15	6	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.7	Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.	mn72	15	7	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.8	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’	mn72	15	8	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:15.9	That’s why a Realized One is freed with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all conceiving, all churning, and all I-making, mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit, I say.”	mn72	15	9	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.1	“But worthy Gotama, when a mendicant’s mind is freed like this, where are they reborn?”	mn72	16	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.2	“‘They’re reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”	mn72	16	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.3	“Well then, are they not reborn?”	mn72	16	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.4	“‘They’re not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”	mn72	16	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.5	“Well then, are they both reborn and not reborn?”	mn72	16	5	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.6	“‘They’re both reborn and not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”	mn72	16	6	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.7	“Well then, are they neither reborn nor not reborn?”	mn72	16	7	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:16.8	“‘They’re neither reborn nor not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”	mn72	16	8	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:17.1	“Worthy Gotama, when asked all these questions, you say: ‘It doesn’t apply.’	mn72	17	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:17.5	I fail to understand this point, worthy Gotama; I’ve fallen into confusion.	mn72	17	5	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:17.6	And I’ve now lost even the degree of clarity I had from previous discussions with the worthy Gotama.”	mn72	17	6	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:18.1	“No wonder you don’t understand, Vaccha, no wonder you’re confused.	mn72	18	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:18.2	For this principle is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	mn72	18	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:18.3	It’s hard for you to understand, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition.	mn72	18	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:18.4	Well then, Vaccha, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn72	18	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.1	What do you think, Vaccha?	mn72	19	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.2	Suppose a fire was burning in front of you. Would you know:	mn72	19	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.3	‘This fire is burning in front of me’?”	mn72	19	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.4	“Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”	mn72	19	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.6	“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:	mn72	19	6	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.7	‘This fire burning in front of you: what does it depend on to burn?’ How would you answer?”	mn72	19	7	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.9	“I would answer like this:	mn72	19	9	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.10	‘This fire burning in front of me burns in dependence on grass and logs as fuel.’”	mn72	19	10	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.11	“Suppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished. Would you know:	mn72	19	11	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.12	‘This fire in front of me is quenched’?”	mn72	19	12	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.13	“Yes, I would, worthy Gotama.”	mn72	19	13	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.15	“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:	mn72	19	15	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.16	‘This fire in front of you that is quenched: in what direction did it go—	mn72	19	16	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.17	east, south, west, or north?’ How would you answer?”	mn72	19	17	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:19.18	“It doesn’t apply, worthy Gotama. The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel. When that runs out, and no more fuel is added, the fire is reckoned to have become quenched due to lack of fuel.”	mn72	19	18	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.1	“In the same way, Vaccha, any form by which a realized one might be described has been given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	mn72	20	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.2	A realized one is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,	mn72	20	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.3	like the ocean.	mn72	20	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.4	‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.	mn72	20	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.5	Any feeling …	mn72	20	5	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.9	perception …	mn72	20	9	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.13	choices …	mn72	20	13	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.17	consciousness by which a realized one might be described has been given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.	mn72	20	17	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.18	A realized one is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,	mn72	20	18	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.19	like the ocean.	mn72	20	19	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:20.20	‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.”	mn72	20	20	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:21.1	When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:	mn72	21	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:21.2	“Worthy Gotama, suppose there was a large sal tree not far from a town or village.	mn72	21	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:21.3	And because it’s impermanent, its branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood would fall off.	mn72	21	3	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:21.4	After some time it would be rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core.	mn72	21	4	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:21.5	In the same way, worthy Gotama’s dispensation is rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core.	mn72	21	5	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:22.1	Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	mn72	22	1	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn72:22.2	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn72	22	2	mn	72	With Vacchagotta on Fire
mn73:1.1	So I have heard.	mn73	1	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn73	1	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:2.1	Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn73	2	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	mn73	2	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.1	“For a long time I have had discussions with the worthy Gotama.	mn73	3	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.2	Please teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillful.”	mn73	3	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.3	“Vaccha, I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detail.	mn73	3	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.4	Still, let me do so in brief.	mn73	3	4	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.5	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn73	3	5	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.6	“Yes, worthy sir,” Vaccha replied.	mn73	3	6	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:3.7	The Buddha said this:	mn73	3	7	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:4.1	“Greed is unskillful, contentment is skillful.	mn73	4	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:4.2	Hate is unskillful, love is skillful.	mn73	4	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:4.3	Delusion is unskillful, understanding is skillful.	mn73	4	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:4.4	So there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillful.	mn73	4	4	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:5.1	Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view: these things are unskillful.	mn73	5	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:5.2	Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; refraining from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, kind-heartedness, and right view: these things are skillful.	mn73	5	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:5.11	So there are these ten unskillful things and ten that are skillful.	mn73	5	11	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:6.1	When a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future, that mendicant is perfected. They’ve ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.”	mn73	6	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:7.1	“Leaving aside the worthy Gotama,	mn73	7	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:7.2	is there even a single monk disciple of the worthy Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”	mn73	7	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta

mn73:17.3	Please teach me further.”	mn73	17	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:18.1	“Well then, Vaccha, further develop two things: serenity and discernment.	mn73	18	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:18.2	When you have further developed these two things, they’ll lead to the penetration of many elements.	mn73	18	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:19.1	Whenever you want, you will be capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range:	mn73	19	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:19.2	‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling my body as far as the realm of divinity.’	mn73	19	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:20.1	Whenever you want, you will be capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range:	mn73	20	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta

mn73:22.1	Whenever you want, you will be capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range:	mn73	22	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:22.2	‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past lives, with features and details.’	mn73	22	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:23.1	Whenever you want, you will be capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range:	mn73	23	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:23.2	‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: “These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And may I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’	mn73	23	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:24.1	Whenever you want, you will be capable of realizing these things, since each and every one is within range:	mn73	24	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:24.2	‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’”	mn73	24	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:25.1	And then Venerable Vacchagotta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn73	25	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:26.1	Then Vacchagotta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn73	26	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:26.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn73	26	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:26.3	And Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfected.	mn73	26	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.1	Now at that time several mendicants were going to see the Buddha.	mn73	27	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.2	Vacchagotta saw them coming off in the distance,	mn73	27	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.3	went up to them, and said,	mn73	27	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.4	“Hello venerables, where are you going?”	mn73	27	4	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.5	“Reverend, we are going to see the Buddha.”	mn73	27	5	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.6	“Well then, reverends, in my name please bow with your head at the Buddha’s feet and say:	mn73	27	6	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.7	‘Sir, the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says,	mn73	27	7	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:27.8	“I have served the Blessed One! I have served the Holy One!”’”	mn73	27	8	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.1	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn73	28	1	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.2	Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn73	28	2	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.3	“Sir, the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says:	mn73	28	3	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.4	‘I have served the Blessed One! I have served the Holy One!’”	mn73	28	4	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.5	“I’ve already comprehended Vacchagotta’s mind and understood that	mn73	28	5	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.6	he has the three knowledges, and is very mighty and powerful.	mn73	28	6	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.7	And deities also told me about this.”	mn73	28	7	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.9	That is what the Buddha said.	mn73	28	9	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn73:28.10	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn73	28	10	mn	73	The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
mn74:1.1	So I have heard.	mn74	1	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain in the Boar’s Cave.	mn74	1	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.1	Then the wanderer Dīghanakha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn74	2	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha,	mn74	2	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.3	“Worthy Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:	mn74	2	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.4	‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’”	mn74	2	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.5	“This view of yours, Aggivessana—	mn74	2	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.6	is that acceptable to you?”	mn74	2	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:2.7	“If I were to accept this view, worthy Gotama, it would make no difference, it would make no difference!”	mn74	2	7	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.1	“Well, Aggivessana, there are many more in the world who say,	mn74	3	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.2	‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’	mn74	3	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.3	But they don’t give up that view, and they grasp another view.	mn74	3	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.4	And there are a scant few in the world who say,	mn74	3	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.5	‘It would make no difference! It would make no difference!’	mn74	3	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:3.6	And they give up that view by not grasping another view.	mn74	3	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn74	4	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.2	‘Everything is acceptable to me.’	mn74	4	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.3	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn74	4	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.4	‘Nothing is acceptable to me.’	mn74	4	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.5	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn74	4	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.6	‘Some things are acceptable to me and some things are not.’	mn74	4	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.7	Regarding this, the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom everything is acceptable	mn74	4	7	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.8	is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.	mn74	4	8	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.9	The view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom nothing is acceptable	mn74	4	9	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:4.10	is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.”	mn74	4	10	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.1	When he said this, the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the Buddha,	mn74	5	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.2	“Worthy Gotama commends my conviction! He recommends my conviction!”	mn74	5	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.3	“Now, regarding the ascetics and brahmins to whom	mn74	5	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.4	some things are acceptable and some things are not.	mn74	5	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.5	Their view of what is acceptable is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.	mn74	5	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:5.6	Their view of what is not acceptable is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.	mn74	5	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.1	When it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom	mn74	6	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.2	everything is acceptable,	mn74	6	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.3	a sensible person reflects like this:	mn74	6	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.4	‘I have the view that	mn74	6	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.5	everything is acceptable.	mn74	6	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.6	Suppose I were to obstinately stick to this view and insist,	mn74	6	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.7	“This is the only truth, anything else is futile.”	mn74	6	7	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.8	Then I’d argue with two people—	mn74	6	8	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.9	an ascetic or brahmin to whom nothing is acceptable,	mn74	6	9	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.10	and an ascetic or brahmin to whom some things are acceptable and some things are not.	mn74	6	10	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.12	And when there’s arguing, there’s quarreling; when there’s quarreling there’s distress; and when there’s anguish there’s harm.’	mn74	6	12	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.13	So, considering in themselves the potential for arguing, quarreling, distress, and harm, they give up that view by not grasping another view.	mn74	6	13	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:6.14	That’s how those views are given up and let go.	mn74	6	14	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:7.1	When it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom	mn74	7	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:7.2	nothing is acceptable,	mn74	7	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha

mn74:7.13	So, considering in themselves the potential for arguing, quarreling, distress, and harm, they give up that view by not grasping another view.	mn74	7	13	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:7.14	That’s how those views are given up and let go.	mn74	7	14	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:8.1	When it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins to whom	mn74	8	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:8.2	some things are acceptable to me and some things are not,	mn74	8	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha

mn74:8.14	That’s how those views are given up and let go.	mn74	8	14	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:9.1	Aggivessana, this body is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. You should see it as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.	mn74	9	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:9.2	Doing so, you’ll give up desire, affection, and subservience to the body.	mn74	9	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.1	There are these three feelings:	mn74	10	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.2	pleasant, painful, and neutral.	mn74	10	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.3	At a time when you feel a pleasant feeling, you don’t feel a painful or neutral feeling;	mn74	10	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.4	you only feel a pleasant feeling.	mn74	10	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.5	At a time when you feel a painful feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or neutral feeling;	mn74	10	5	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.6	you only feel a painful feeling.	mn74	10	6	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.7	At a time when you feel a neutral feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or painful feeling;	mn74	10	7	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:10.8	you only feel a neutral feeling.	mn74	10	8	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:11.1	Pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.	mn74	11	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:12.1	Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings.	mn74	12	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:12.2	Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn74	12	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:12.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn74	12	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:13.1	A mendicant whose mind is freed like this doesn’t side with anyone or dispute with anyone. They use the language of the world to communicate without getting stuck on it.”	mn74	13	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:14.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.	mn74	14	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:14.2	Then he thought,	mn74	14	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:14.3	“It seems the Buddha speaks of giving up and letting go all these things through direct knowledge.”	mn74	14	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:14.4	Reflecting like this, Venerable Sāriputta’s mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping.	mn74	14	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:15.1	And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the wanderer Dīghanakha:	mn74	15	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:15.2	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	mn74	15	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:15.3	Then Dīghanakha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:	mn74	15	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:16.1	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn74	16	1	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:16.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn74	16	2	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:16.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn74	16	3	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn74:16.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn74	16	4	mn	74	With Dīghanakha
mn75:1.1	So I have heard.	mn75	1	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan.	mn75	1	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kammāsadamma for alms.	mn75	2	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.	mn75	2	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:2.3	Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate.	mn75	2	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:3.1	Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber.	mn75	3	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:3.2	He saw the grass mat spread out there	mn75	3	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:3.3	and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan,	mn75	3	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:3.4	“Worthy Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.”	mn75	3	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:4.1	“There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.	mn75	4	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:4.2	He has this good reputation:	mn75	4	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:4.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn75	4	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:4.4	This bed has been spread for that worthy Gotama.”	mn75	4	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.1	“Well, it’s a sad sight, worthy Bhāradvāja,	mn75	5	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.2	a very sad sight indeed,	mn75	5	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.3	to see a bed for the worthy Gotama, that baby-killer!”	mn75	5	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.4	“Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya,	mn75	5	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.5	be careful what you say.	mn75	5	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.6	Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are devoted to the worthy Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble system, the skillful teaching.”	mn75	5	6	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.7	“Even if I was to see the worthy Gotama face to face, worthy Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face:	mn75	5	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.8	‘The ascetic Gotama is a baby-killer.’	mn75	5	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.9	Why is that?	mn75	5	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.10	For so it came to me while sleeping.”	mn75	5	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.11	“If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.”	mn75	5	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:5.12	“Don’t worry, worthy Bhāradvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.”	mn75	5	12	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.	mn75	6	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.2	Coming out of retreat, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber and sat on the grass mat.	mn75	6	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.3	Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn75	6	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn75	6	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.5	“Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?”	mn75	6	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.6	When he said this, the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, said to the Buddha,	mn75	6	6	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.7	“I wanted to mention this very thing to the worthy Gotama,	mn75	6	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:6.8	but you brought it up before I had a chance.”	mn75	6	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:7.1	But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished.	mn75	7	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:7.2	Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn75	7	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:7.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him:	mn75	7	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.1	“Māgaṇḍiya, the eye likes sights, it loves them and enjoys them.	mn75	8	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.2	That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.	mn75	8	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.3	Is that what you were referring to when you called me	mn75	8	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.4	a baby-killer?”	mn75	8	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.5	“That’s exactly what I was referring to.	mn75	8	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.7	Why is that?	mn75	8	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.8	For so it came to me while sleeping.”	mn75	8	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.9	“The ear likes sounds …	mn75	8	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.10	The nose likes smells …	mn75	8	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.11	The tongue likes tastes …	mn75	8	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.19	The body likes touches …	mn75	8	19	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.20	The mind likes ideas, it loves them and enjoys them.	mn75	8	20	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.21	That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.	mn75	8	21	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.22	Is that what you were referring to when you called me	mn75	8	22	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.23	a baby-killer?”	mn75	8	23	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.24	“That’s exactly what I was referring to.	mn75	8	24	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.26	Why is that?	mn75	8	26	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:8.27	For so it came to me while sleeping.”	mn75	8	27	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.1	“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?	mn75	9	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.2	Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sights—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.	mn75	9	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.3	What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”	mn75	9	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.4	“Nothing, worthy Gotama.”	mn75	9	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.5	“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?	mn75	9	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:9.11	What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”	mn75	9	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:9.12	“Nothing, worthy Gotama.”	mn75	9	12	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.1	“Well, when I was still a layperson I used to amuse myself, supplied and provided with sights known by the eye … sounds known by the ear …	mn75	10	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:10.5	I had three stilt longhouses—	mn75	10	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.6	one for the rainy season, one for the winter, and one for the summer.	mn75	10	6	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.7	I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.	mn75	10	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.8	Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasures—I live rid of thirst, my mind peaceful inside.	mn75	10	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.9	I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.	mn75	10	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.10	I don’t envy them, nor do I hope to enjoy that.	mn75	10	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.11	Why is that?	mn75	10	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.12	Because there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities,	mn75	10	12	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:10.13	which even equals heavenly pleasure.	mn75	10	13	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:11.1	Suppose there was a householder or a householder’s child who was rich, affluent, and wealthy. And they would amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. That is, sights known by the eye …	mn75	11	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:11.4	Having practiced good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three.	mn75	11	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:11.5	There they’d amuse themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.	mn75	11	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:11.6	Then they’d see a householder or a householder’s child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn75	11	6	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:11.7	What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya? Would that god—amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation—envy that householder or householder’s child their five kinds of human sensual stimulation, or return to human sensual pleasures?”	mn75	11	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:11.8	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn75	11	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:11.9	Why is that?	mn75	11	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:13.2	Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.	mn75	13	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:13.9	Why is that?	mn75	13	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:17.2	The more they scratch their wounds and cauterize their body, the more their wounds become foul, stinking, and infected. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the itchiness of their wounds.	mn75	17	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:17.3	In the same way, I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.	mn75	17	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:17.4	The more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows, and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures.

mn75:18.1	What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?	mn75	18	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:18.2	Have you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past, future, or present, amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, who—without giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures—lives rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside?”	mn75	18	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:18.3	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn75	18	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:18.5	Neither have I.	mn75	18	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:19.1	Then on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	mn75	19	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.2	“Health is the ultimate blessing;	mn75	19	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.3	extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.	mn75	19	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.4	Of paths, the ultimate is eightfold—	mn75	19	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.5	it’s safe, and leads to freedom from death.”	mn75	19	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.6	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,	mn75	19	6	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.7	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	mn75	19	7	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.8	How well said this was by the worthy Gotama!	mn75	19	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.9	‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’	mn75	19	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.10	I’ve also heard that wanderers of the past, the tutors of tutors, said:	mn75	19	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.11	‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’	mn75	19	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.12	And it agrees, worthy Gotama.”	mn75	19	12	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.13	“But Māgaṇḍiya, when you heard that wanderers of the past said this,	mn75	19	13	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.14	what is that health? And what is that extinguishment?”	mn75	19	14	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.15	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya stroked his own limbs with his hands, saying:	mn75	19	15	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:19.16	“This is that health, worthy Gotama, this is that extinguishment!	mn75	19	16	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:20.9	‘White cloth is really nice, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’	mn75	20	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:20.10	What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?	mn75	20	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:20.11	Did that person blind from birth do this knowing and seeing,	mn75	20	11	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:20.12	or out of faith in the sighted person?”	mn75	20	12	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:20.13	“They did so not knowing or seeing,	mn75	20	13	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:20.14	but out of faith in the sighted person.”	mn75	20	14	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:21.1	“In the same way, the wanderers of other religions are blind and sightless. Not knowing health and not seeing extinguishment, they still recite this verse:	mn75	21	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:21.2	‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’	mn75	21	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:21.3	For this verse was recited by the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas of the past:	mn75	21	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:21.4	‘Health is the ultimate blessing;	mn75	21	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:21.9	But Māgaṇḍiya, this body is a disease, a boil, a dart, a misery, an affliction. Yet you say of this body:	mn75	21	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:21.10	‘This is that health, this is that extinguishment!’	mn75	21	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:23.17	‘For such a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by that person with this dirty, soiled garment when he said,	mn75	23	17	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:24.8	My grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.	mn75	24	8	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:24.9	That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’”	mn75	24	9	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya

mn75:25.10	That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”	mn75	25	10	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:26.1	When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,	mn75	26	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:26.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn75	26	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:26.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn75	26	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:26.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn75	26	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:26.5	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	mn75	26	5	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:27.1	“Māgaṇḍiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	mn75	27	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:27.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	mn75	27	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:27.3	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	mn75	27	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:28.1	And the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn75	28	1	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:28.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Māgaṇḍiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn75	28	2	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:28.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn75	28	3	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn75:28.4	And Venerable Māgaṇḍiya became one of the perfected.	mn75	28	4	mn	75	With Māgaṇḍiya
mn76:1.1	So I have heard.	mn76	1	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	mn76	1	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:2.1	Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers.	mn76	2	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants:	mn76	3	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:3.2	“Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.”	mn76	3	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:3.3	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn76	3	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:3.4	Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool.	mn76	3	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.1	Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	mn76	4	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	mn76	4	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.3	Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance,	mn76	4	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.4	and hushed his own assembly,	mn76	4	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	mn76	4	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.6	The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.	mn76	4	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.7	He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī.	mn76	4	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.8	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.	mn76	4	8	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.9	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	mn76	4	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:4.10	Then those wanderers fell silent.	mn76	4	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.1	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka,	mn76	5	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.2	who said to him,	mn76	5	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.3	“Come, worthy Ānanda! Welcome, worthy Ānanda!	mn76	5	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.4	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn76	5	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.5	Please sit down, this seat is ready.”	mn76	5	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.6	Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,	mn76	5	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.7	while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn76	5	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.8	Ānanda said to Sandaka,	mn76	5	8	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.9	“Sandaka, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn76	5	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.10	“Worthy Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	mn76	5	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.11	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	mn76	5	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.12	It’d be great if the worthy Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition.”	mn76	5	12	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.13	“Well then, Sandaka, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn76	5	13	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.14	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Sandaka.	mn76	5	14	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:5.15	Venerable Ānanda said this:	mn76	5	15	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:6.1	“Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”	mn76	6	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:6.2	“But worthy Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”	mn76	6	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.1	“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:	mn76	7	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.	mn76	7	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.3	This person is made up of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space.	mn76	7	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.4	Four men with a bier carry away the corpse.	mn76	7	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.5	Their footprints show the way to the cemetery.	mn76	7	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.6	The bones become bleached.	mn76	7	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.7	Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes.	mn76	7	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.8	Giving is a doctrine of morons.	mn76	7	8	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.9	When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense.	mn76	7	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:7.10	Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and they don’t exist after death.’	mn76	7	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	8	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.2	‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.	mn76	8	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.11	If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it	mn76	8	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.12	have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up, and we don’t exist after death.	mn76	8	12	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.13	But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.	mn76	8	13	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.14	What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?	mn76	8	14	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.15	This negates the spiritual life.’	mn76	8	15	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:8.16	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	8	16	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:9.1	This is the first way that negates the spiritual life.	mn76	9	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.1	Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:	mn76	10	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.2	‘The one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.	mn76	10	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.3	If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.	mn76	10	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.4	If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.	mn76	10	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.5	If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit.	mn76	10	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:10.6	In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’	mn76	10	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:11.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	11	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:11.2	‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.	mn76	11	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:11.7	If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it	mn76	11	7	mn	76	With Sandaka

mn76:11.10	What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?	mn76	11	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:11.11	This negates the spiritual life.’	mn76	11	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:11.12	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	11	12	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:12.1	This is the second way that negates the spiritual life.	mn76	12	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.1	Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:	mn76	13	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.2	‘There is no cause or reason for the corruption of sentient beings.	mn76	13	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.3	Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason.	mn76	13	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.4	There’s no cause or reason for the purification of sentient beings.	mn76	13	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.5	Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.	mn76	13	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.6	There is no power, no energy, no human strength or vigor.	mn76	13	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:13.7	All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.’	mn76	13	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	14	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.2	‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.	mn76	14	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.6	If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it	mn76	14	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.7	have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are purified without cause or reason.	mn76	14	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.8	But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.	mn76	14	8	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.9	What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?	mn76	14	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.10	This negates the spiritual life.’	mn76	14	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:14.11	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	14	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:15.1	This is the third way that negates the spiritual life.	mn76	15	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.1	Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:	mn76	16	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.2	‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	mn76	16	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.3	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other.	mn76	16	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.4	What seven?	mn76	16	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.5	The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh.	mn76	16	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.6	These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.	mn76	16	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.7	They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other.	mn76	16	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.8	And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand.	mn76	16	8	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.9	If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life.	mn76	16	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.10	The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.	mn76	16	10	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.11	There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven knotless embryos. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven rivers, 700 rivers, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.	mn76	16	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.12	And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be.	mn76	16	12	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.13	Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse.	mn76	16	13	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.14	It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling.	mn76	16	14	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:16.15	In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’	mn76	16	15	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	17	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.2	‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.	mn76	17	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.18	If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it	mn76	17	18	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.19	have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that after transmigrating both of us will make an end of suffering.	mn76	17	19	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.20	But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.	mn76	17	20	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.21	What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?	mn76	17	21	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.22	This negates the spiritual life.’	mn76	17	22	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:17.23	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	17	23	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:18.1	This is the fourth way that negates the spiritual life.	mn76	18	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:19.1	These are the four ways that negate the spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”	mn76	19	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:20.1	“It’s incredible, worthy Ānanda, it’s amazing,	mn76	20	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:20.2	how these four ways that negate the spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha.	mn76	20	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:20.3	But worthy Ānanda, what are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”	mn76	20	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:21.1	“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	mn76	21	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:21.2	‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	mn76	21	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:21.3	They enter an empty house; they get no almsfood; a dog bites them; they encounter a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow; they ask the name and clan of a woman or man; they ask the name and path to a village or town.	mn76	21	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:21.4	When asked, ‘Why is this?’ they answer: ‘I had to enter an empty house, that’s why I entered it. I had to get no almsfood, that’s why I got none. I had to get bitten by a dog, that’s why I was bitten. I had to encounter a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow, that’s why I encountered them. I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or man, that’s why I asked. I had to ask the name and path to a village or town, that’s why I asked.’	mn76	21	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:22.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	22	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:22.2	‘This teacher makes such a claim, but they answer in such a way.	mn76	22	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:22.3	This spiritual life is unreliable.’	mn76	22	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:22.4	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	22	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:23.1	This is the first kind of unreliable spiritual life.	mn76	23	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:24.1	Furthermore, take another teacher who is an oral transmitter, who takes oral transmission to be the truth.	mn76	24	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:24.2	They teach by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority.	mn76	24	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:24.3	But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth, some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise.	mn76	24	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:25.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	25	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:25.2	‘This teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth. He teaches by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority.	mn76	25	2	mn	76	With Sandaka

mn76:25.4	This spiritual life is unreliable.’	mn76	25	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:25.5	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	25	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:26.1	This is the second kind of unreliable spiritual life.	mn76	26	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:27.1	Furthermore, take another teacher who relies on logic and inquiry.	mn76	27	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:27.2	They teach what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective.	mn76	27	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:27.3	But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry, some of that is well reasoned, some poorly reasoned, some true, and some otherwise.	mn76	27	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	28	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.2	‘This teacher relies on logic and inquiry.	mn76	28	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.3	They teach what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective.	mn76	28	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.4	But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry, some of that is well reasoned, some poorly reasoned, some true, and some otherwise.	mn76	28	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.5	This spiritual life is unreliable.’	mn76	28	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:28.6	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	28	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:29.1	This is the third kind of unreliable spiritual life.	mn76	29	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:30.1	Furthermore, take another teacher who is dull and stupid.	mn76	30	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:30.2	Because of that, whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops:	mn76	30	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:30.3	‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’	mn76	30	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.1	A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:	mn76	31	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.2	‘This teacher is dull and stupid.	mn76	31	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.3	Because of that, whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to verbal flip-flops and endless flip-flops:	mn76	31	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.4	“I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.”	mn76	31	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.5	This spiritual life is unreliable.’	mn76	31	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:31.6	Realizing this, they leave disappointed.	mn76	31	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:32.1	This is the fourth kind of unreliable spiritual life.	mn76	32	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:33.1	These are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t complete the system of the skillful teaching.”	mn76	33	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:34.1	“It’s incredible, worthy Ānanda, it’s amazing,	mn76	34	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:34.2	how these four kinds of unreliable spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha.	mn76	34	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:34.3	But, worthy Ānanda, what would a teacher say and explain so that a sensible person would, to the best of their ability, practice such a spiritual path, and once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching?”	mn76	34	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:35-42.1	“Sandaka, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. …	mn76	35-42	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:35-42.2	He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn76	35-42	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:35-42.3	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn76	35-42	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:35-42.4	A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, lead the spiritual life with a teacher under whom they achieve such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching.	mn76	35-42	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:43.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption …	mn76	43	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:44-45.1	third absorption …	mn76	44-45	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:46.1	fourth absorption.	mn76	46	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:46.2	A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching.	mn76	46	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:47.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn76	47	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:47.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn76	47	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:47.3	A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, lead the spiritual life with a teacher under whom they achieve such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching.	mn76	47	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:48.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn76	48	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:48.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn76	48	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:48.3	A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, lead the spiritual life with a teacher under whom they achieve such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching.	mn76	48	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:49.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn76	49	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:49.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn76	49	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:49.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn76	49	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:50.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn76	50	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:50.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn76	50	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:50.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn76	50	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:50.4	A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, lead the spiritual life with a teacher under whom they achieve such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the system of the skillful teaching.”	mn76	50	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:51.1	“But worthy Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—could they still enjoy sensual pleasures?”	mn76	51	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:51.2	“Sandaka, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in five respects.	mn76	51	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:51.3	A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they used to as a lay person.	mn76	51	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:51.4	A mendicant who is perfected can’t transgress in these five respects.”	mn76	51	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.1	“But worthy Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected, would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?”	mn76	52	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.3	“Well then, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile.	mn76	52	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.4	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	mn76	52	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.5	Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated.	mn76	52	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.6	Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?	mn76	52	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.7	Or would they be aware of it only when they checked it?”	mn76	52	7	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.9	“They wouldn’t be aware of it constantly,	mn76	52	9	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.11	only when they checked it.”	mn76	52	11	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.13	“In the same way, when a mendicant is perfected, the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.	mn76	52	13	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:52.15	Rather, they are aware of it only when they checked it.”	mn76	52	15	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.1	“But Reverend Ānanda, in this teaching and training, how many are emancipated?”	mn76	53	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.2	“There are not just one hundred who are emancipated, Sandaka, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that in this teaching and training.”	mn76	53	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.3	“It’s incredible, worthy Ānanda, it’s amazing!	mn76	53	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.4	Namely, that there’s no glorifying one’s own teaching and putting down the teaching of others. The Dhamma is taught in its own field, and so many emancipated are recognized.	mn76	53	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.5	But these Ājīvakas, sons of she whose sons are dead, glorify themselves and put others down. And they only recognize three who have been emancipated:	mn76	53	5	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:53.6	Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.”	mn76	53	6	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:54.1	Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly,	mn76	54	1	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:54.2	“Go, good fellows. The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic Gotama.	mn76	54	2	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:54.3	It’s not easy for me to forsake possessions, honor, or popularity now.”	mn76	54	3	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn76:54.4	And that’s how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.	mn76	54	4	mn	76	With Sandaka
mn77:1.1	So I have heard.	mn77	1	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn77	1	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.	mn77	2	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:2.2	They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.	mn77	2	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	mn77	3	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	mn77	3	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	mn77	3	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:3.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”	mn77	3	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.1	So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.	mn77	4	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.2	Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	mn77	4	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.3	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	mn77	4	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.4	Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn77	4	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.5	and hushed his own assembly,	mn77	4	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.6	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	mn77	4	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.8	Here comes the ascetic Gotama.	mn77	4	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.9	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	mn77	4	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.10	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	mn77	4	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:4.11	Then those wanderers fell silent.	mn77	4	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.1	Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,	mn77	5	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.2	who said to him,	mn77	5	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	mn77	5	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	mn77	5	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn77	5	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	mn77	5	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.8	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	mn77	5	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.9	while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn77	5	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.10	The Buddha said to him,	mn77	5	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:5.11	“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn77	5	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.1	“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	mn77	6	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.2	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	mn77	6	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.3	Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them:	mn77	6	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.4	‘The people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate, so very fortunate!	mn77	6	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.5	For there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. And they have come down for the rainy season residence at Rājagaha.	mn77	6	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.6	They include Pūraṇa Kassapa,	mn77	6	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.8	the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla,	mn77	6	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.9	Ajita of the hair blanket,	mn77	6	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.10	Pakudha Kaccāyana,	mn77	6	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.11	Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,	mn77	6	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.12	and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.	mn77	6	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.14	This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.	mn77	6	14	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.15	And he too has come down for the rains residence at Rājagaha.	mn77	6	15	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.16	Which of these ascetics and brahmins is honored, respected, revered, and venerated by their disciples? And how do their disciples, honoring and respecting them, remain loyal?’	mn77	6	16	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.17	Some of them said:	mn77	6	17	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.18	‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.	mn77	6	18	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.19	But he’s not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.	mn77	6	19	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.20	Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.	mn77	6	20	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.21	Then one of his disciples made a noise,	mn77	6	21	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.22	“My good fellows, don’t ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about that.	mn77	6	22	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.23	He doesn’t know that.	mn77	6	23	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.24	I know it. Ask me about it,	mn77	6	24	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.25	and I’ll answer you.”	mn77	6	25	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.26	Once it so happened that Pūraṇa Kassapa didn’t get his way, though he called out with raised arms,	mn77	6	26	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.27	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	mn77	6	27	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.28	They’re not asking you, they’re asking me!	mn77	6	28	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.29	I’ll answer you!”	mn77	6	29	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.30	Indeed, many of his disciples have left him after refuting his doctrine:	mn77	6	30	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.31	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	mn77	6	31	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.32	That’s how Pūraṇa Kassapa is not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.	mn77	6	32	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:6.33	Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’	mn77	6	33	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:6.59	Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.	mn77	6	59	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

For even after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we weren’t able to practice for life the perfectly full and pure spiritual life.”	mn77	6	70	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:7.1	“But Udāyī, how many qualities do you see in me, because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me?”	mn77	7	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.1	“Sir, I see five such qualities in the Buddha.	mn77	8	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.2	What five?	mn77	8	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.3	The Buddha eats little and praises eating little.	mn77	8	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.4	This is the first such quality I see in the Buddha.	mn77	8	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.5	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment.	mn77	8	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.6	This is the second such quality I see in the Buddha.	mn77	8	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.7	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of almsfood, and praises such contentment.	mn77	8	7	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.8	This is the third such quality I see in the Buddha.	mn77	8	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.9	Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of lodging, and praises such contentment.	mn77	8	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.10	This is the fourth such quality I see in the Buddha.	mn77	8	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.11	Furthermore, the Buddha is secluded, and praises seclusion.	mn77	8	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.12	This is the fifth such quality I see in the Buddha.	mn77	8	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:8.13	These are the five qualities I see in the Buddha, because of which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate him; and honoring and respecting him, they remain loyal to him.”	mn77	8	13	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.1	“Suppose, Udāyī, my disciples were loyal to me because I eat little. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat a tumbler of food, or half a tumbler; they eat a wood-apple, or half a wood-apple.	mn77	9	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.2	But sometimes I even eat this bowl full to the brim, or even more.	mn77	9	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.3	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I eat little, then those disciples who eat even less would not be loyal to me.	mn77	9	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.4	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe. Well, there are disciples of mine who have rag robes, wearing shabby robes. They gather scraps from charnel grounds, rubbish dumps, and shops, make them into a patchwork robe and wear it.	mn77	9	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.5	But sometimes I wear robes offered by householders that are strong, yet next to which bottle-gourd down is coarse.	mn77	9	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.6	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe, then those disciples who wear rag robes would not be loyal to me.	mn77	9	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.7	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of almsfood. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, happy to eat whatever they glean. When they’ve entered an inhabited area, they don’t consent when invited to sit down.	mn77	9	7	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.8	But sometimes I even eat by invitation boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces.	mn77	9	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.9	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of almsfood, then those disciples who eat only almsfood would not be loyal to me.	mn77	9	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.10	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging. Well, there are disciples of mine who stay at the root of a tree, in the open air. For eight months they don’t go under a roof.	mn77	9	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.11	But sometimes I even stay in bungalows, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.	mn77	9	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.12	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging, then those disciples who stay at the root of a tree would not be loyal to me.	mn77	9	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.13	Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m secluded and I praise seclusion. Well, there are disciples of mine who live in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. Having ventured deep into remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, they live there, coming down to the midst of the Saṅgha each fortnight for the recitation of the monastic code.	mn77	9	13	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.14	But sometimes I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	mn77	9	14	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.15	So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m secluded and praise seclusion, then those disciples who live in the wilderness would not be loyal to me.	mn77	9	15	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:9.16	So, Udāyī, it’s not because of these five qualities that my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.	mn77	9	16	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:10.1	There are five other qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.	mn77	10	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:10.2	What five?	mn77	10	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:10.3	Firstly, my disciples esteem me for the higher ethics:	mn77	10	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:10.4	‘The ascetic Gotama is ethical. He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degree.’	mn77	10	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:11.1	Since this is so,	mn77	11	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:11.2	this is the first quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	mn77	11	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.1	Furthermore, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision:	mn77	12	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.2	‘The ascetic Gotama only claims to know when he does in fact know.	mn77	12	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.3	He only claims to see when he really does see.	mn77	12	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.4	He teaches based on direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge.	mn77	12	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.5	He teaches based on reason, not without reason.	mn77	12	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.6	He teaches with a demonstrable basis, not without it.’	mn77	12	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.7	Since this is so,	mn77	12	7	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:12.12	this is the second quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	mn77	12	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.1	Furthermore, my disciples esteem me for my higher wisdom:	mn77	13	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is wise. He possesses the entire spectrum of wisdom to the highest degree.	mn77	13	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.3	It’s not possible that he would fail to foresee grounds for future criticism, or to legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up.’	mn77	13	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.4	What do you think, Udāyī?	mn77	13	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.5	Would my disciples, knowing and seeing this, break in and interrupt me?”	mn77	13	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.6	“No, sir.”	mn77	13	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.7	“That’s because I don’t expect to be instructed by my disciples.	mn77	13	7	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.8	Invariably, my disciples expect instruction from me.	mn77	13	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.9	Since this is so,	mn77	13	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:13.13	this is the third quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	mn77	13	13	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:14.1	Furthermore, my disciples come to me and ask how the noble truth of suffering applies to the suffering in which they are swamped and mired. And I provide them with a satisfying answer to their question.	mn77	14	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:14.2	They ask how the noble truths of the origin of suffering,	mn77	14	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:14.3	the cessation of suffering,	mn77	14	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:14.4	and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering apply to the suffering  in which they are swamped and mired. And I provide them with satisfying answers to their questions.	mn77	14	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:25.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four absorptions.	mn77	25	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:25.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn77	25	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:25.3	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn77	25	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:25.4	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	mn77	25	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:25.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn77	25	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:26.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn77	26	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:26.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn77	26	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:26.3	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time.	mn77	26	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:26.4	But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	mn77	26	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:26.5	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn77	26	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:27.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn77	27	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:27.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn77	27	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:27.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.	mn77	27	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:27.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn77	27	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:28.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn77	28	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:28.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	mn77	28	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:28.3	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.	mn77	28	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:28.4	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.	mn77	28	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:28.5	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	28	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:	mn77	29	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.2	‘This body of mine is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	mn77	29	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.3	And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’	mn77	29	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.4	Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.	mn77	29	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.5	And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.	mn77	29	5	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.6	And someone with clear eyes were to take it in their hand and check it:	mn77	29	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.7	‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.	mn77	29	7	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.8	And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’	mn77	29	8	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.9	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:	mn77	29	9	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.10	‘This body of mine is formed. It’s made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.	mn77	29	10	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.11	And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’	mn77	29	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:29.12	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	29	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:30.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body—formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	mn77	30	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:30.2	Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath.	mn77	30	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:30.3	They’d think:	mn77	30	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:30.4	‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’	mn77	30	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:30.11	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body—formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty.	mn77	30	11	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:30.12	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	30	12	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:31.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the realm of divinity.	mn77	31	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:31.2	Suppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like.	mn77	31	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:31.6	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	31	6	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:32.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	mn77	32	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī

mn77:34.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn77	34	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:34.2	Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’	mn77	34	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:34.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives.	mn77	34	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:34.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	34	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:35.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn77	35	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:35.2	Suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.	mn77	35	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:35.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn …	mn77	35	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:35.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	35	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:36.1	Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	mn77	36	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:36.2	Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with clear eyes standing on the bank would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’	mn77	36	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:36.3	In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.

mn77:36.4	And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.	mn77	36	4	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:37.1	This is the fifth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.	mn77	37	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:38.1	These are the five qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.”	mn77	38	1	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:38.2	That is what the Buddha said.	mn77	38	2	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn77:38.3	Satisfied, the wanderer Sakuludāyī approved what the Buddha said.	mn77	38	3	mn	77	The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
mn78:1.1	So I have heard.	mn78	1	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn78	1	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta was residing together with around five hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.	mn78	1	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.1	Then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.	mn78	2	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.2	It occurred to him,	mn78	2	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.3	“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha,	mn78	2	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.4	as he’s in retreat.	mn78	2	4	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.5	And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants,	mn78	2	5	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.6	as they’re in retreat.	mn78	2	6	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.7	Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna?”	mn78	2	7	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:2.8	So that’s what he did.	mn78	2	8	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.1	Now at that time, Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	mn78	3	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	mn78	3	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.3	Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance,	mn78	3	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.4	and hushed his own assembly,	mn78	3	4	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	mn78	3	5	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.6	Here comes Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.	mn78	3	6	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.7	He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī.	mn78	3	7	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.8	Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.	mn78	3	8	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.9	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	mn78	3	9	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:3.10	Then those wanderers fell silent.	mn78	3	10	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:4.1	Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn78	4	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Uggāhamāna said to him:	mn78	4	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:5.1	“Householder, when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	mn78	5	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:5.2	What four?	mn78	5	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:5.3	It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.	mn78	5	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:5.4	When an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic.”	mn78	5	4	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:6.1	Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed the wanderer Uggāhamāna’s statement.	mn78	6	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:6.2	He got up from his seat, thinking,	mn78	6	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:6.3	“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”	mn78	6	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:7.1	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	mn78	7	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:7.2	and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed.	mn78	7	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	mn78	8	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.2	“Chamberlain, if what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	mn78	8	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.3	For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘a body’, so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body, aside from just wriggling?	mn78	8	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.4	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘speech’, so how could they possibly speak bad words, aside from just crying?	mn78	8	4	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.5	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘thought’, so how could they possibly think bad thoughts, aside from just whimpering?	mn78	8	5	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.6	And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘livelihood’, so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood, aside from their mother’s breast?	mn78	8	6	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.7	If what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	mn78	8	7	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.8	When an individual has four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment—but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.	mn78	8	8	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.9	What four?	mn78	8	9	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.10	It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood.	mn78	8	10	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:8.11	When an individual has these four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic, but as having achieved the same level as a little baby.	mn78	8	11	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:9.1	When an individual has ten qualities, chamberlain, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment.	mn78	9	1	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:9.2	The following things must be understood, I say. ‘These are unskillful behaviors.’	mn78	9	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:9.4	‘Unskillful behaviors stem from this.’	mn78	9	4	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta

mn78:10.2	Unskillful deeds by way of body and speech, and bad livelihood.	mn78	10	2	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:10.3	These are called unskillful behaviors.	mn78	10	3	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta

mn78:10.5	Where they stem from has been stated.	mn78	10	5	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn78:10.6	You should say that they stem from the mind.	mn78	10	6	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta

mn78:14.5	Satisfied, Pañcakaṅga the chamberlain approved what the Buddha said.	mn78	14	5	mn	78	With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamaṇḍikāputta
mn79:1.1	So I have heard.	mn79	1	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn79	1	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing together with a large assembly of wanderers in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.	mn79	1	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	mn79	2	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:2.2	Then it occurred to him,	mn79	2	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:2.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	mn79	2	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:2.4	Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”	mn79	2	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:2.5	Then the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.	mn79	2	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.1	Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as	mn79	3	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.2	talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.	mn79	3	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.3	Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn79	3	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.4	and hushed his own assembly,	mn79	3	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.5	“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound.	mn79	3	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.6	Here comes the ascetic Gotama.	mn79	3	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.7	The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.	mn79	3	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.8	Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”	mn79	3	8	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:3.9	Then those wanderers fell silent.	mn79	3	9	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.1	Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,	mn79	4	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.2	who said to him,	mn79	4	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.3	“Let the Blessed One come, sir!	mn79	4	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.4	Welcome to the Blessed One, sir!	mn79	4	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.5	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn79	4	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.6	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	mn79	4	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.8	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	mn79	4	8	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.9	while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn79	4	9	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.10	The Buddha said to him,	mn79	4	10	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:4.11	“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn79	4	11	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.1	“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.	mn79	5	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.2	It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.	mn79	5	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.3	When I don’t come to the assembly, they sit and engage in all kinds of low talk.	mn79	5	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.4	But when I have come to the assembly, they sit gazing up at my face alone, thinking,	mn79	5	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.5	‘Whatever the ascetic Udāyī teaches, we shall listen to it.’	mn79	5	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.6	But when the Buddha has come to the assembly, both myself and the assembly sit gazing up at your face, thinking,	mn79	5	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:5.7	‘Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.’”	mn79	5	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.1	“Well then, Udāyī, suggest something for me to talk about.”	mn79	6	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.2	“Sir, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’	mn79	6	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.3	When I asked them a question about the past, they dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.	mn79	6	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.4	That reminded me of the Buddha:	mn79	6	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.5	‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’”	mn79	6	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.6	“But Udāyī, who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a way?”	mn79	6	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:6.7	“It was the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, sir.”	mn79	6	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.1	“Udāyī, someone who can recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details, might ask me a question about the past, or I might ask them a question about the past.	mn79	7	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.2	And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.	mn79	7	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.3	Someone who, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds might ask me a question about the future, or I might ask them a question about the future.	mn79	7	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.4	And they might satisfy me with their answer, or I might satisfy them with my answer.	mn79	7	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.5	Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.	mn79	7	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.6	I shall teach you the Dhamma:	mn79	7	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.7	‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	mn79	7	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:7.8	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.’”	mn79	7	8	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.1	“Well sir, I can’t even recall with features and details what I’ve undergone in this incarnation.	mn79	8	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.2	How should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details, like the Buddha?	mn79	8	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.3	For I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.	mn79	8	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.4	How should I possibly, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn, like the Buddha?	mn79	8	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.5	But then the Buddha told me,	mn79	8	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.6	‘Nevertheless, Udāyī, leave aside the past and the future.	mn79	8	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.7	I shall teach you the Dhamma:	mn79	8	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.8	“When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.	mn79	8	8	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.9	When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.”’ But that is even more unclear to me.	mn79	8	9	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:8.10	Perhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own tradition.”	mn79	8	10	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.1	“But Udāyī, what is your own tradition?”	mn79	9	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.2	“Sir, it’s this:	mn79	9	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.3	‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’”	mn79	9	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.4	“But what is that ultimate splendor?”	mn79	9	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.6	“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	mn79	9	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.7	“But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer?”	mn79	9	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:9.8	“Sir, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	mn79	9	8	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.1	“Udāyī, you could draw this out for a long time.	mn79	10	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.2	You say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.	mn79	10	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī

mn79:10.9	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’	mn79	10	9	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.10	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	mn79	10	10	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī

mn79:10.13	Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’	mn79	10	13	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.14	What do you think, Udāyī?	mn79	10	14	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.15	This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	mn79	10	15	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.16	“Clearly that’s the case, sir.”	mn79	10	16	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:10.17	“In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”	mn79	10	17	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:11.1	“Worthy sir, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is free of disease after death.”	mn79	11	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:12.1	“What do you think, Udāyī?	mn79	12	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī

mn79:25.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption.	mn79	25	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:25.3	With the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption.	mn79	25	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:25.4	This is the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	mn79	25	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:25.5	“Sir, that’s not the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness. At that point a perfectly happy world has already been realized.”	mn79	25	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:25.6	“No, Udāyī, at that point a perfectly happy world has not been realized.	mn79	25	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:25.7	This is the grounded practice for realizing a world of perfect happiness.”	mn79	25	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:26.1	When he said this, Sakuludāyī’s assembly made an uproar, a dreadful racket,	mn79	26	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:26.2	“In that case, we’re lost, and so are our traditional teachings! We’re lost, and so are our traditional teachings!	mn79	26	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:26.3	We know nothing higher than this!”	mn79	26	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:26.4	Then Sakuludāyī, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha,	mn79	26	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:27.1	“Well sir, at what point is a perfectly happy world realized?”	mn79	27	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī

mn79:27.3	There are deities who have been reborn in a perfectly happy world. That mendicant associates with them, converses, and engages in discussion.	mn79	27	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:27.4	It’s at this point that a perfectly happy world has been realized.”	mn79	27	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:28.1	“Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy world?”	mn79	28	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī

mn79:28.3	There are other things that are finer, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.”	mn79	28	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:28.4	“But what are those finer things?”	mn79	28	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:29-36.1	“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. …	mn79	29-36	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:37.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn79	37	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:37.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption.	mn79	37	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:37.3	This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.	mn79	37	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:38-40.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …	mn79	38-40	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:38-40.2	third absorption …	mn79	38-40	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:38-40.3	fourth absorption.	mn79	38-40	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:38-40.4	This too is one of the finer things.	mn79	38-40	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:41.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn79	41	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:41.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn79	41	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:41.3	This too is one of the finer things.	mn79	41	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:42.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn79	42	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:42.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn79	42	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:42.3	This too is one of the finer things.	mn79	42	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:43.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn79	43	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:43.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn79	43	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:43.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn79	43	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:44.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn79	44	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:44.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn79	44	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:44.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn79	44	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:44.4	This too is one of the finer things.	mn79	44	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:44.5	These are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.”	mn79	44	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:45.1	When he had spoken, Sakuludāyī said to the Buddha,	mn79	45	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:45.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	mn79	45	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:45.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn79	45	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:45.4	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn79	45	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:45.5	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	mn79	45	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.1	When he said this, Sakuludāyī’s assembly said to him,	mn79	46	1	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.2	“Worthy Udāyī, don’t lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.	mn79	46	2	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.3	You have been a tutor; don’t live as a pupil.	mn79	46	3	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.4	You’ll end up like a water jar that turns into a water ladle.	mn79	46	4	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.5	Worthy Udāyī, don’t lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.	mn79	46	5	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.6	You have been a tutor; don’t live as a pupil.”	mn79	46	6	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn79:46.7	And that’s how the wanderer Sakuludāyī’s own assembly prevented him from leading the spiritual life under the Buddha.	mn79	46	7	mn	79	The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
mn80:1.1	So I have heard.	mn80	1	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn80	1	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.1	Then the wanderer Vekhanasa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn80	2	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side,	mn80	2	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.3	and expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	mn80	2	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.4	“This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.”	mn80	2	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.5	“But Kaccāna, why do you say:	mn80	2	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.6	‘This is the ultimate splendor, this is the ultimate splendor.’	mn80	2	6	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.7	What is that ultimate splendor?”	mn80	2	7	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.8	“Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	mn80	2	8	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.9	“But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer?”	mn80	2	9	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:2.10	“Worthy Gotama, the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.”	mn80	2	10	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.1	“Kaccāna, you could draw this out for a long time.	mn80	3	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.2	You say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.	mn80	3	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.3	Suppose a man was to say,	mn80	3	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.4	‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her I desire!’	mn80	3	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.5	They’d say to him,	mn80	3	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.6	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	mn80	3	6	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.7	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	mn80	3	7	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.8	They’d say to him,	mn80	3	8	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.9	‘Worthy man, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’	mn80	3	9	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.10	Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’	mn80	3	10	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.11	They’d say to him,	mn80	3	11	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.12	‘Worthy man, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’	mn80	3	12	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.13	Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’	mn80	3	13	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.14	What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	3	14	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.15	This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”	mn80	3	15	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.16	“Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.”	mn80	3	16	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:3.17	“In the same way, you say, ‘The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’ But you don’t describe that splendor.”	mn80	3	17	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate. Such is the splendor of the self that is healthy after death.”	mn80	4	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:5.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	5	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:5.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: such a beryl gem, or a firefly in the dark of night?”	mn80	5	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:5.3	“A firefly in the dark of night.”	mn80	5	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:6.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	6	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:6.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a firefly in the dark of night, or an oil lamp in the dark of night?”	mn80	6	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:6.3	“An oil lamp in the dark of night.”	mn80	6	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:7.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	7	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:7.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: an oil lamp in the dark of night, or a great mass of fire in the dark of night?”	mn80	7	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:7.3	“A great mass of fire in the dark of night.”	mn80	7	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:8.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	8	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:8.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: a great mass of fire in the dark of night, or the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn?”	mn80	8	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:8.3	“The Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn.”	mn80	8	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:9.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	9	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:9.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the Morning Star in the clear and cloudless heavens at the crack of dawn, or the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath?”	mn80	9	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:9.3	“The full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath.”	mn80	9	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:10.1	“What do you think, Kaccāna?	mn80	10	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:10.2	Which of these two has a finer splendor: the full moon at midnight in the clear and cloudless heavens on the fifteenth day sabbath, or the sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn?”	mn80	10	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:10.3	“The sun at midday in the clear and cloudless heavens in the last month of the rainy season, in autumn.”	mn80	10	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:11.1	“Beyond this, Kaccāna, I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon makes no impression.	mn80	11	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:11.2	Nevertheless, I do not say:	mn80	11	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:11.3	‘The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer.’	mn80	11	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:11.4	But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say, ‘This is the ultimate splendor.’ And you don’t describe that splendor.	mn80	11	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.1	Kaccāna, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn80	12	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.2	What five?	mn80	12	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn80	12	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.4	Sounds known by the ear …	mn80	12	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.5	Smells known by the nose …	mn80	12	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn80	12	6	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn80	12	7	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:12.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn80	12	8	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:13.1	The pleasure and happiness that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.	mn80	13	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:13.2	‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.’”	mn80	13	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,	mn80	14	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.2	“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!	mn80	14	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.3	How well said this was by the worthy Gotama!	mn80	14	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.4	‘From the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.’	mn80	14	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.5	Worthy Gotama, from the senses comes sensual pleasure. Beyond sensual pleasure is the pleasure that surmounts the sensual, which is said to be the best of these.”	mn80	14	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.6	“Kaccāna, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, then, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition, it’s hard for you to understand	mn80	14	6	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.7	the senses, sensual pleasure, and the pleasure that surmounts the sensual.	mn80	14	7	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.8	There are mendicants who are perfected, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. They can understand	mn80	14	8	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:14.9	the senses, sensual pleasure, and the pleasure that surmounts the sensual.”	mn80	14	9	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:15.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa became angry and upset. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,	mn80	15	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:15.2	“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha,	mn80	15	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:15.3	“This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins. Not knowing the past or seeing the future, they nevertheless claim:	mn80	15	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:15.4	‘We understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’	mn80	15	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:15.5	Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow.”	mn80	15	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.1	“Kaccāna, there are some ascetics and brahmins who, not knowing the past or seeing the future, nevertheless claim:	mn80	16	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.2	‘We understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.”’	mn80	16	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.3	There is a legitimate refutation of them.	mn80	16	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.4	Nevertheless, Kaccāna, leave aside the past and the future.	mn80	16	4	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.5	Let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them.	mn80	16	5	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.6	Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves,	mn80	16	6	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.7	‘So this is how to be rightly released from the bond, that is, the bond of ignorance.’	mn80	16	7	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.8	Suppose there was a little baby bound with swaddling up to the neck.	mn80	16	8	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.9	As they grow up and their senses mature, they’re accordingly released from those bonds.	mn80	16	9	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.10	They’d know ‘I’m released,’ and there would be no more bonds.	mn80	16	10	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.11	In the same way, let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them.	mn80	16	11	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.12	Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves,	mn80	16	12	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:16.13	‘So this is how to be rightly released from the bond, that is, the bond of ignorance.’”	mn80	16	13	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:17.1	When he said this, Vekhanasa said to the Buddha,	mn80	17	1	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:17.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	mn80	17	2	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn80:17.3	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn80	17	3	mn	80	With Vekhanasa
mn81:1.1	So I have heard.	mn81	1	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn81	1	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.1	Then the Buddha left the road, and at a certain spot he smiled.	mn81	2	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.2	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	mn81	2	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.3	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	mn81	2	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.4	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	mn81	2	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.5	So Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	mn81	2	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.6	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	mn81	2	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:2.7	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	mn81	2	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.	mn81	3	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:3.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.	mn81	3	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:3.3	It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,	mn81	3	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:3.4	where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.”	mn81	3	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:4.1	Then Ānanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the Buddha,	mn81	4	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:4.2	“Well then, sir, may the Blessed One sit here!	mn81	4	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:4.3	Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.”	mn81	4	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:4.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out.	mn81	4	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:4.5	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	mn81	4	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:5.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of humans.	mn81	5	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:5.2	And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga.	mn81	5	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:5.3	It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery,	mn81	5	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:5.4	where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.	mn81	5	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.1	The Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	6	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.2	Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla, a student.	mn81	6	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.3	Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	mn81	6	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.4	‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	6	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.5	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	6	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.6	When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,	mn81	6	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.7	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	6	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.8	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	mn81	6	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.9	For a second time …	mn81	6	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.10	and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	mn81	6	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.11	‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	6	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.12	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	6	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.13	For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,	mn81	6	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.14	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	6	14	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.15	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	mn81	6	15	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.16	‘Well then, dear Jotipāla, let’s take some bathing cleanser and go to the river to bathe.’	mn81	6	16	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.17	‘Yes, dear,’ replied Jotipāla.	mn81	6	17	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:6.18	So that’s what they did.	mn81	6	18	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	mn81	7	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	mn81	7	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	7	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	7	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.5	When he said this, Jotipāla said to him,	mn81	7	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.6	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	7	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.7	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	mn81	7	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.8	For a second time …	mn81	7	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.9	and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla,	mn81	7	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.10	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	mn81	7	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.11	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	7	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.12	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	7	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.13	For a third time, Jotipāla said to him,	mn81	7	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.14	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	7	14	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:7.15	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	mn81	7	15	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the skirt-hem and said,	mn81	8	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	mn81	8	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	8	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	8	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.5	So Jotipāla undid his skirt-hem and said to Ghaṭīkāra,	mn81	8	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.6	‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	8	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:8.7	What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’	mn81	8	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshly-washed head and said,	mn81	9	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.2	‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away.	mn81	9	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.3	Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn81	9	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.4	For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	9	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.5	Then Jotipāla thought,	mn81	9	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.6	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	mn81	9	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.7	how this potter Ghaṭīkāra, though of lowly birth, should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshly-washed head!	mn81	9	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.8	This must be no ordinary matter.’	mn81	9	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.9	He said to Ghaṭīkāra,	mn81	9	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.10	‘You’d even milk it to this extent, dear Ghaṭīkāra?’	mn81	9	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.11	‘I even milk it to this extent, dear Jotipāla.	mn81	9	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.12	For that is how holy I deem it to see that Blessed One.’	mn81	9	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:9.13	‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, release me, we shall go.’	mn81	9	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the student went to the Buddha Kassapa. Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side, but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one side.	mn81	10	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.2	Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa,	mn81	10	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.3	‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend.	mn81	10	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.4	Please teach him the Dhamma.’	mn81	10	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.5	Then the Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk.	mn81	10	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:10.6	Then they got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	mn81	10	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:11.1	Then Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra,	mn81	11	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:11.2	‘Dear Ghaṭīkāra, you have heard this teaching, so why don’t you go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn81	11	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:11.3	‘Don’t you know, dear Jotipāla, that I  provide for my blind old parents?’	mn81	11	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:11.4	‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn81	11	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:12.1	Then Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa, bowed and sat down to one side. Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa,	mn81	12	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:12.2	‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend.	mn81	12	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:12.3	Please give him the going forth.’	mn81	12	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:12.4	And Jotipāla the student received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn81	12	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:13.1	Not long after Jotipāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha Kassapa—having stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he pleased—set out for Varanasi.	mn81	13	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:13.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Varanasi,	mn81	13	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:13.3	where he stayed near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	mn81	13	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.1	King Kikī of Kāsi heard that he had arrived.	mn81	14	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.2	He had the finest carriages harnessed. He then mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Varanasi to see the Buddha Kassapa.	mn81	14	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side.	mn81	14	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.4	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	mn81	14	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.5	Then King Kikī said to the Buddha,	mn81	14	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.6	‘Sir, would the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?’	mn81	14	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:14.7	The Buddha Kassapa consented with silence.	mn81	14	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:15.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, King Kikī got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn81	15	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:16.1	And when the night had passed, King Kikī had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home—soft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	mn81	16	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:16.2	‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’	mn81	16	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.1	Then Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of King Kikī, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn81	17	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.2	Then King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn81	17	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.3	When the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn81	17	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.4	There he said to the Buddha Kassapa,	mn81	17	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.5	‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season.	mn81	17	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.6	The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’	mn81	17	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.7	‘Enough, great king.	mn81	17	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.8	I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’	mn81	17	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.9	For a second time …	mn81	17	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.10	and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,	mn81	17	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.11	‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season.	mn81	17	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.12	The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’	mn81	17	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.13	‘Enough, Great King.	mn81	17	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.14	I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’	mn81	17	14	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.15	Then King Kikī, thinking, ‘The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,’ became sad and upset.	mn81	17	15	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.16	Then King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa,	mn81	17	16	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:17.17	‘Sir, do you have another supporter better than me?’	mn81	17	17	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.1	‘Great king, there is a market town named Vebhaliṅga,	mn81	18	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.2	where there is a potter named Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	18	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.3	He is my chief supporter.	mn81	18	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.4	Now, great king, when you thought, “The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,” you became sad and upset.	mn81	18	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.5	But Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t get upset, nor will he.	mn81	18	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.6	Ghaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	mn81	18	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.7	He doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	mn81	18	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.8	He has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.	mn81	18	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.9	He is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	mn81	18	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.10	He eats in one part of the day; he’s chaste, ethical, and of good character.	mn81	18	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.11	He has set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and currency.	mn81	18	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.12	He has put down the shovel and doesn’t dig the earth with his own hands.	mn81	18	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.13	He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice, and brings it back in a carrier. When he has made a pot, he says,	mn81	18	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.14	“Anyone may leave bagged sesame, mung beans, or chickpeas here and take what they wish.”	mn81	18	14	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.15	He provided for his blind old parents.	mn81	18	15	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:18.16	And since he has ended the five lower fetters, Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.	mn81	18	16	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.1	This one time, great king, I was staying near the market town of Vebhaliṅga.	mn81	19	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.2	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them,	mn81	19	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.3	“Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”	mn81	19	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.4	“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”	mn81	19	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.5	So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.	mn81	19	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.6	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	mn81	19	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.7	“Who took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”	mn81	19	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.8	“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”	mn81	19	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	mn81	19	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.10	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn81	19	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.11	in that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much!”	mn81	19	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:19.12	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	mn81	19	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.1	Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga.	mn81	20	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.2	Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them,	mn81	20	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.3	“Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”	mn81	20	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.4	“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.”	mn81	20	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.5	So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.	mn81	20	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.6	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	mn81	20	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.7	“Who took porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”	mn81	20	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.8	“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”	mn81	20	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	mn81	20	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.10	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn81	20	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.11	to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!”	mn81	20	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:20.12	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	mn81	20	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.1	Another time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga.	mn81	21	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.2	Now at that time my hut leaked.	mn81	21	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.3	So I addressed the mendicants,	mn81	21	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.4	“Mendicants, go to Ghaṭīkāra’s home and find some grass.”	mn81	21	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.5	When I said this, those mendicants said to me,	mn81	21	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.6	“Sir, there’s no grass there, but his workshop has a grass roof.”	mn81	21	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.7	“Then go to the workshop and strip the grass.”	mn81	21	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.8	So that’s what they did.	mn81	21	8	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.9	Then Ghaṭīkāra’s parents said to those mendicants,	mn81	21	9	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.10	“Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?”	mn81	21	10	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.11	“It’s the mendicants, sister. The Buddha’s hut is leaking.”	mn81	21	11	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.12	“Take it, sirs! Take it, dearest ones!”	mn81	21	12	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.13	Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said,	mn81	21	13	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.14	“Who stripped the grass from the workshop?”	mn81	21	14	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.15	“It was the mendicants, dear. It seems the Buddha’s hut is leaking.”	mn81	21	15	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.16	Then Ghaṭīkāra thought,	mn81	21	16	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.17	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn81	21	17	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.18	to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!”	mn81	21	18	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.19	Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.	mn81	21	19	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.20	Then the workshop remained with the atmosphere for a roof for the whole three months, but the heavens did not rain on it.	mn81	21	20	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.21	And that, great king, is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is like.’	mn81	21	21	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.22	‘Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate, very fortunate,	mn81	21	22	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:21.23	to be so trusted by the Buddha Kassapa.’	mn81	21	23	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.1	Then King Kikī sent around five hundred loads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce to Ghaṭīkāra.	mn81	22	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.2	Then one of the king’s men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said,	mn81	22	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.3	‘Sir, these five hundred loads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce have been sent to you by King Kikī of Kāsi.	mn81	22	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.4	Please accept them.’	mn81	22	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.5	‘The king has many duties, and much to do.	mn81	22	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.6	I have enough.	mn81	22	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:22.7	Let this be for the king himself.’	mn81	22	7	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.1	Ānanda, you might think:	mn81	23	1	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.2	‘Surely the student Jotipāla must have been someone else at that time?’	mn81	23	2	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.3	But you should not see it like this.	mn81	23	3	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.4	I myself was the student Jotipāla at that time.”	mn81	23	4	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn81	23	5	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn81:23.6	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn81	23	6	mn	81	With Ghaṭīkāra
mn82:1.1	So I have heard.	mn82	1	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhika.	mn82	1	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika heard:	mn82	2	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn82	2	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn82	2	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn82	2	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn82	2	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn82	2	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn82	2	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	mn82	3	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:3.2	When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.	mn82	3	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:4.1	Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, was sitting in the assembly.	mn82	4	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:4.2	He thought,	mn82	4	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:4.3	“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn82	4	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:4.4	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	mn82	4	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:5.1	Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	mn82	5	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.1	Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn82	6	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.2	“Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn82	6	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.3	I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	6	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.4	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?	mn82	6	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.5	May the Buddha please give me the going forth!”	mn82	6	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.6	“But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?”	mn82	6	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.7	“No, sir.”	mn82	6	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.8	“Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.”	mn82	6	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:6.9	“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”	mn82	6	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said,	mn82	7	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.2	“Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn82	7	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.3	I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	7	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.4	Please give me permission to go forth.”	mn82	7	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.5	When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,	mn82	7	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.6	“But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	mn82	7	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.7	You know nothing of suffering.	mn82	7	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.8	Even when you die we will lose you against our wishes.	mn82	7	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.9	So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”	mn82	7	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.10	For a second time,	mn82	7	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.11	and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.	mn82	7	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.20	Then Raṭṭhapāla thought,	mn82	7	20	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.21	“My parents don’t allow me to go forth.” He laid down right there on the bare ground, saying,	mn82	7	21	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.22	“I’ll either die right here or go forth.”	mn82	7	22	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:7.23	And he refused to eat, up to the seventh meal.	mn82	7	23	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,	mn82	8	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.2	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	mn82	8	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.3	You know nothing of suffering.	mn82	8	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.4	When you die we will lose you against our wishes.	mn82	8	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.5	So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while you’re still living?	mn82	8	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.6	Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.	mn82	8	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.7	While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.	mn82	8	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.8	We don’t allow you to go forth.	mn82	8	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.9	When you die we will lose you against our wishes.	mn82	8	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.10	So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”	mn82	8	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.11	When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.	mn82	8	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.12	For a second time,	mn82	8	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:8.14	and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents made the same request.	mn82	8	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:9.1	And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent. Raṭṭhapāla’s parents then went to see his friends. They told them of the situation and asked for their help.	mn82	9	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,	mn82	10	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.2	“Our friend Raṭṭhapāla, you are your parents’ only child. You’re dear to them and they love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.	mn82	10	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.3	You know nothing of suffering.	mn82	10	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.4	When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes.	mn82	10	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.5	So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?	mn82	10	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.6	Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.	mn82	10	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.7	While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.	mn82	10	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.8	Your parents will not allow you to go forth.	mn82	10	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.9	Even when you die your parents will lose you against their wishes.	mn82	10	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.10	So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”	mn82	10	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.11	When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.	mn82	10	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.12	For a second time,	mn82	10	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.13	and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s friends made the same request.	mn82	10	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:10.19	And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.	mn82	10	19	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to his parents and said,	mn82	11	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.2	“Mum and dad, Raṭṭhapāla is lying there on the bare ground saying:	mn82	11	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.3	‘I’ll either die right here or go forth.’	mn82	11	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.4	If you don’t allow him to go forth, he’ll die there.	mn82	11	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.5	But if you do allow him to go forth, you’ll see him again afterwards.	mn82	11	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.6	And if he doesn’t enjoy the renunciate life, where else will he have to go? He’ll come right back here.	mn82	11	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.7	Please give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth.”	mn82	11	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.8	“Then, dears, we give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth.	mn82	11	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.9	But once gone forth he must visit his parents.”	mn82	11	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.10	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,	mn82	11	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.11	“Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Your parents have given you permission to go forth from lay life to homelessness.	mn82	11	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:11.12	But once gone forth you must visit your parents.”	mn82	11	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:12.1	Raṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strength. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn82	12	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:12.2	“Sir, I have my parents’ permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	12	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:12.3	May the Buddha please give me the going forth.”	mn82	12	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:13.1	And Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn82	13	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:13.2	Not long after Venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha—having stayed in Thullakoṭṭhika as long as he pleased—set out for Sāvatthī.	mn82	13	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:13.3	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,	mn82	13	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:13.4	where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn82	13	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:14.1	Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	14	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:14.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn82	14	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:14.3	And Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfected.	mn82	14	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.1	Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn82	15	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.2	“Sir, I would like to visit my parents, if the Buddha allows it.”	mn82	15	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.3	Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapāla’s mind.	mn82	15	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.4	When he knew that	mn82	15	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.5	it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life, he said,	mn82	15	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:15.6	“Please, Raṭṭhapāla, go at your convenience.”	mn82	15	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:16.1	And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Thullakoṭṭhika.	mn82	16	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:16.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika,	mn82	16	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:16.3	where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer range.	mn82	16	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:16.4	Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhika for alms.	mn82	16	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:16.5	Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood, he approached his own father’s house.	mn82	16	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.1	Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate.	mn82	17	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.2	He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance	mn82	17	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.3	and said,	mn82	17	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.4	“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!”	mn82	17	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.5	And at his own father’s home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal,	mn82	17	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:17.6	but only abuse.	mn82	17	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.1	Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge.	mn82	18	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.2	So Raṭṭhapāla said to her,	mn82	18	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.3	“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.”	mn82	18	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.4	As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.	mn82	18	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.5	She then went to his mother and said,	mn82	18	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.6	“Please, madam, you should know this.	mn82	18	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.7	Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”	mn82	18	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.8	“If you speak the truth, wench, I’ll make you a free woman!”	mn82	18	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.9	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said,	mn82	18	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.10	“Please householder, you should know this.	mn82	18	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:18.11	It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”	mn82	18	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.1	Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall.	mn82	19	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.2	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him and said,	mn82	19	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.3	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla! How can you be eating last night’s porridge?	mn82	19	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.4	Why not go to your own home?”	mn82	19	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.5	“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house?	mn82	19	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.6	We are homeless, householder.	mn82	19	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.7	I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal,	mn82	19	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.8	but only abuse.”	mn82	19	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.9	“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.”	mn82	19	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.10	“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.”	mn82	19	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.11	“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	mn82	19	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:19.12	Raṭṭhapāla consented with silence.	mn82	19	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:20.1	Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house. He made a heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, and hid it under mats. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives,	mn82	20	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:20.2	“Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.”	mn82	20	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:21.1	And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying,	mn82	21	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:21.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	mn82	21	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, said to him,	mn82	22	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.2	“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one.	mn82	22	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.3	You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit.	mn82	22	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.4	Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!”	mn82	22	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.5	“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river.	mn82	22	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.6	Why is that?	mn82	22	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:22.7	Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”	mn82	22	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:23.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said,	mn82	23	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:23.2	“What are they like, master, the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life?”	mn82	23	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:23.3	“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.”	mn82	23	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:23.4	Saying, “Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters!” they fainted right away.	mn82	23	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father,	mn82	24	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.2	“If there is food to be given, householder, please give it.	mn82	24	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.3	But don’t harass me.”	mn82	24	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.4	“Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla. The meal is ready.”	mn82	24	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.5	Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn82	24	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:24.6	When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, he recited this verse while standing right there:	mn82	24	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.1	“See this fancy puppet,	mn82	25	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.2	a body built of sores,	mn82	25	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.3	diseased, obsessed over,	mn82	25	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.4	in which nothing lasts at all.	mn82	25	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.5	See this fancy figure,	mn82	25	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.6	with its gems and earrings;	mn82	25	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.7	it is bones encased in skin,	mn82	25	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.8	made pretty by its clothes.	mn82	25	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.9	Rouged feet	mn82	25	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.10	and powdered face	mn82	25	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.11	may be enough to beguile a fool,	mn82	25	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.12	but not a seeker of the far shore.	mn82	25	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.13	Hair in eight braids	mn82	25	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.14	and eyeshadow	mn82	25	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.15	may be enough to beguile a fool,	mn82	25	15	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.16	but not a seeker of the far shore.	mn82	25	16	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.17	A rotting body all adorned	mn82	25	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.18	like a freshly painted makeup box	mn82	25	18	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.19	may be enough to beguile a fool,	mn82	25	19	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.20	but not a seeker of the far shore.	mn82	25	20	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.21	The hunter laid his snare,	mn82	25	21	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.22	but the deer didn’t spring the trap.	mn82	25	22	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.23	I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,	mn82	25	23	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:25.24	leaving the trapper to lament.”	mn82	25	24	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:26.1	Then Raṭṭhapāla, having recited this verse while standing, went to King Koravya’s deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	mn82	26	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.1	Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper,	mn82	27	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.2	“My good gamekeeper, tidy up the park of the deer range.	mn82	27	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.3	We will go to see the scenery.”	mn82	27	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the gamekeeper. While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation.	mn82	27	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.5	Seeing this, he went to the king, and said,	mn82	27	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.6	“The deer range is tidy, sire.	mn82	27	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.7	And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, of whom you have often spoken highly, is meditating there at the root of a tree.”	mn82	27	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.8	“Well then, my good gamekeeper, that’s enough of the park for today.	mn82	27	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:27.9	Now I shall pay homage to the worthy Raṭṭhapāla.”	mn82	27	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.1	And then King Koravya said, “Give away the fresh and cooked foods that have been prepared there.” He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhika to see Raṭṭhapāla.	mn82	28	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot, together with a group of eminent officials. They exchanged greetings, and, when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to Raṭṭhapāla:	mn82	28	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.3	“Here, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, sit on this elephant rug.”	mn82	28	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.4	“Enough, great king, you sit on it.	mn82	28	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.5	I’m sitting on my own seat.”	mn82	28	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:28.6	So the king sat down on the seat spread out, and said:	mn82	28	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:29.1	“Worthy Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	29	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:29.2	What four?	mn82	29	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:29.3	Decay due to old age, decay due to sickness, decay of wealth, and decay of relatives.	mn82	29	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.1	And what is decay due to old age?	mn82	30	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.2	It’s when someone is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life.	mn82	30	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.3	They reflect:	mn82	30	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.4	‘I’m now old, elderly, and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.	mn82	30	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.5	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	mn82	30	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn82	30	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.7	So because of that decay due to old age they go forth.	mn82	30	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.8	This is called decay due to old age.	mn82	30	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.9	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.	mn82	30	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.10	You have no decay due to old age.	mn82	30	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:30.11	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	mn82	30	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.1	And what is decay due to sickness?	mn82	31	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.2	It’s when someone is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn82	31	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.3	They reflect:	mn82	31	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.4	‘I’m now sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn82	31	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.5	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	mn82	31	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.6	Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn82	31	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.7	So because of that decay due to sickness they go forth.	mn82	31	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.8	This is called decay due to sickness.	mn82	31	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.9	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now rarely ill or unwell. Your stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold.	mn82	31	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.10	You have no decay due to sickness.	mn82	31	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:31.11	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	mn82	31	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.1	And what is decay of wealth?	mn82	32	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.2	It’s when someone is rich, affluent, and wealthy.	mn82	32	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.3	But gradually their wealth dwindles away.	mn82	32	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.4	They reflect:	mn82	32	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.5	‘I used to be rich, affluent, and wealthy.	mn82	32	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.6	But gradually my wealth has dwindled away.	mn82	32	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.7	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	mn82	32	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.8	Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn82	32	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.9	So because of that decay of wealth they go forth.	mn82	32	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.10	This is called decay of wealth.	mn82	32	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.11	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan here in Thullakoṭṭhika.	mn82	32	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.12	You have no decay of wealth.	mn82	32	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:32.13	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	mn82	32	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.1	And what is decay of relatives?	mn82	33	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.2	It’s when someone has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.	mn82	33	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.3	But gradually their relatives dwindle away.	mn82	33	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.4	They reflect:	mn82	33	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.5	‘I used to have many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.	mn82	33	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.6	But gradually they’ve dwindled away.	mn82	33	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.7	It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.	mn82	33	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.8	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn82	33	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.9	So because of that decay of relatives they go forth.	mn82	33	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.10	This is called decay of relatives.	mn82	33	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.11	But worthy Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin right here in Thullakoṭṭhika.	mn82	33	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.12	You have no decay of relatives.	mn82	33	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:33.13	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?	mn82	33	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:34.1	There are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	34	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:34.2	Worthy Raṭṭhapāla has none of these.	mn82	34	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:34.3	So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?”	mn82	34	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:35.1	“Great king, the Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has taught these four summaries of the teaching for recitation. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn82	35	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:35.2	What four?	mn82	35	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.1	‘The world is unstable and swept away.’	mn82	36	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.2	This is the first summary.	mn82	36	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.3	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’	mn82	36	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.4	This is the second summary.	mn82	36	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.5	‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’	mn82	36	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.6	This is the third summary.	mn82	36	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.7	‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’	mn82	36	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:36.8	This is the fourth summary.	mn82	36	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:37.1	The Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha taught these four summaries of the teaching. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	mn82	37	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.1	“‘The world is unstable and swept away.’	mn82	38	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.2	So the worthy Raṭṭhapāla said.	mn82	38	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.3	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn82	38	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.4	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	38	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.5	When you were twenty or twenty-five years of age, were you proficient at riding elephants, horses, and chariots, and at archery and swordsmanship? Were you strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”	mn82	38	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.6	“I was, worthy Raṭṭhapāla.	mn82	38	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.7	Sometimes it seems as if I had superpowers then. I don’t see anyone who could have equalled me in strength.”	mn82	38	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.8	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	38	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.9	These days are you just as strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”	mn82	38	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.10	“No, worthy Raṭṭhapāla.	mn82	38	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.11	For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.	mn82	38	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.12	Sometimes I intend to step in one place, but my foot goes somewhere else.”	mn82	38	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.13	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	mn82	38	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.14	‘The world is unstable and swept away.’”	mn82	38	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.16	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	mn82	38	16	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.17	how well said this was by the Buddha.	mn82	38	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:38.19	For the world is indeed unstable and swept away.	mn82	38	19	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.1	In this royal court you can find divisions of elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry. They will serve to defend us from any threats. Yet you said:	mn82	39	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.2	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’	mn82	39	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.4	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn82	39	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.5	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	39	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.6	Do you have any chronic ailments?”	mn82	39	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.7	“Yes, I do.	mn82	39	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.8	Sometimes my friends and colleagues, relatives and kin surround me, thinking:	mn82	39	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.9	‘Now the king will die! Now the king will die!’”	mn82	39	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.10	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	39	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.11	Can you get your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin to help:	mn82	39	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.12	‘Please, my dear friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, all of you here share my pain so that I may feel less pain.’	mn82	39	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.13	Or must you alone feel that pain?”	mn82	39	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.14	“I can’t get my friends to share my pain.	mn82	39	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.16	Rather, I alone must feel it.”	mn82	39	16	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.17	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	mn82	39	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.18	‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’”	mn82	39	18	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.20	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	mn82	39	20	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.21	how well said this was by the Buddha.	mn82	39	21	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:39.23	For the world indeed has no shelter and no savior.	mn82	39	23	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.1	In this royal court you can find abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. Yet you said:	mn82	40	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.2	‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’	mn82	40	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.4	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn82	40	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.5	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	40	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.6	These days you amuse yourself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. But is there any way to ensure that in the next life	mn82	40	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.7	you will continue to amuse yourself in the same way, supplied and provided with the same five kinds of sensual stimulation? Or will others make use of this property, while you pass on according to your deeds?”	mn82	40	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.8	“There’s no way to ensure that I will continue to amuse myself in the same way.	mn82	40	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.10	Rather, others will take over this property, while I pass on according to my deeds.”	mn82	40	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.11	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	mn82	40	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.12	‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’”	mn82	40	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.14	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	mn82	40	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.15	how well said this was by the Buddha.	mn82	40	15	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:40.17	For the world indeed has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.	mn82	40	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.1	You also said this: ‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’	mn82	41	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.3	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn82	41	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.4	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	41	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.5	Do you reign over the prosperous land of Kuru?”	mn82	41	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.6	“Indeed I do.”	mn82	41	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.7	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	41	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.8	Suppose a trustworthy and dependable man were to come from the east.	mn82	41	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.9	He’d approach you and say:	mn82	41	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.10	‘Please great king, you should know this. I come from the east.	mn82	41	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.11	There I saw a large country that is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people.	mn82	41	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.12	They have many divisions of elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry.	mn82	41	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.13	And there’s plenty of money and grain,	mn82	41	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.14	plenty of gold, coined and uncoined, worked and unworked,	mn82	41	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.15	and plenty of women for the taking.	mn82	41	15	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.16	With your current forces you can conquer it.	mn82	41	16	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.17	Conquer it, great king!’ What would you do?”	mn82	41	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.18	“I would conquer it and reign over it.”	mn82	41	18	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.19	“What do you think, great king?	mn82	41	19	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.20	Suppose a trustworthy and dependable man were to come from the west,	mn82	41	20	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.21	north,	mn82	41	21	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.22	south,	mn82	41	22	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.23	or from over the ocean.	mn82	41	23	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.24	He’d approach you and say the same thing.	mn82	41	24	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.32	What would you do?”	mn82	41	32	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.33	“I would conquer it and reign over it.”	mn82	41	33	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.34	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	mn82	41	34	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.35	‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’	mn82	41	35	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.36	And it was after knowing and seeing and hearing this that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	mn82	41	36	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.37	“It’s incredible, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,	mn82	41	37	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.38	how well said this was by the Buddha.	mn82	41	38	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:41.40	For the world is indeed wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.”	mn82	41	40	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.1	This is what Venerable Raṭṭhapāla said.	mn82	42	1	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.2	Then he went on to say:	mn82	42	2	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.3	“I see rich humans in the world who,	mn82	42	3	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.4	because of delusion, give not <j>the wealth they’ve earned.	mn82	42	4	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.5	Greedily, they hoard their riches,	mn82	42	5	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.6	yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.	mn82	42	6	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.7	A king who conquered the earth by force,	mn82	42	7	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.8	ruling the land from sea to sea,	mn82	42	8	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.9	unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,	mn82	42	9	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.10	would still yearn for the further shore.	mn82	42	10	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.11	Not just the king, but others too,	mn82	42	11	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.12	reach death not rid of craving.	mn82	42	12	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.13	They leave the body still wanting,	mn82	42	13	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.14	for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy.	mn82	42	14	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.15	Relatives lament, their hair disheveled,	mn82	42	15	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.16	saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’	mn82	42	16	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.17	They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,	mn82	42	17	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.18	heap up a pyre, and burn it there.	mn82	42	18	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.19	It’s poked with stakes while being burnt,	mn82	42	19	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.20	in just a single cloth, all wealth gone.	mn82	42	20	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.21	Relatives, friends, and companions	mn82	42	21	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.22	can’t help you when you’re dying.	mn82	42	22	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.23	Heirs take your riches,	mn82	42	23	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.24	while beings fare on according to their deeds.	mn82	42	24	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.25	Riches don’t follow you when you die;	mn82	42	25	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.26	nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.	mn82	42	26	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.27	Longevity isn’t gained by riches,	mn82	42	27	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.28	nor does wealth banish old age;	mn82	42	28	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.29	for the attentive say this life is short,	mn82	42	29	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.30	it’s perishable and not eternal.	mn82	42	30	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.31	The rich and the poor feel its touch;	mn82	42	31	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.32	the fool and the attentive one feel it too.	mn82	42	32	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.33	But the fool lies stricken by their own folly,	mn82	42	33	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.34	while the attentive one does not tremble at the touch.	mn82	42	34	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.35	Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth,	mn82	42	35	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.36	since by wisdom <j>you reach consummation in this life.	mn82	42	36	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.37	But if because of delusion <j>you don’t reach consummation,	mn82	42	37	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.38	you’ll do evil deeds in life after life.	mn82	42	38	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.39	One who enters a womb and the world beyond,	mn82	42	39	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.40	will transmigrate from one life to the next.	mn82	42	40	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.41	While someone of little wisdom, <j>placing faith in them,	mn82	42	41	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.42	also enters a womb and the world beyond.	mn82	42	42	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.43	As a bandit caught in a window	mn82	42	43	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.44	is punished for his own bad deeds;	mn82	42	44	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.45	so after departing, in the world beyond,	mn82	42	45	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.46	people are punished for their own bad deeds.	mn82	42	46	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.47	Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful;	mn82	42	47	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.48	appearing in disguise they disturb the mind.	mn82	42	48	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.49	Seeing danger in sensual stimulations,	mn82	42	49	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.50	I went forth, O King.	mn82	42	50	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.51	As fruit falls from a tree, so the sons of Manu fall,	mn82	42	51	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.52	young and old, when the body breaks up.	mn82	42	52	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.53	Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;	mn82	42	53	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn82:42.54	the ascetic life is unfailingly better.”	mn82	42	54	mn	82	With Raṭṭhapāla
mn83:1.1	So I have heard.	mn83	1	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Mithilā in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	mn83	1	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.1	Then the Buddha smiled at a certain spot.	mn83	2	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.2	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	mn83	2	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.3	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	mn83	2	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.4	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	mn83	2	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.5	So Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	mn83	2	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.6	“What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled?	mn83	2	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:2.7	Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”	mn83	2	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:3.1	“Once upon a time, Ānanda, right here in Mithilā there was a just and principled king named Maghadeva, a great king who stood by his duty.	mn83	3	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:3.2	He justly treated brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	mn83	3	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:3.3	And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.	mn83	3	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva addressed his barber,	mn83	4	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.2	‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’	mn83	4	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.3	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber.	mn83	4	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.4	When many thousand years had passed, the barber saw grey hairs growing on the king’s head.	mn83	4	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.5	He said to the king,	mn83	4	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.6	‘The messengers of the gods have shown themselves to you. Grey hairs can be seen growing on your head.’	mn83	4	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.7	‘Well then, my dear barber, carefully pull them out with tweezers and place them in my cupped hands.’	mn83	4	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.8	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the barber, and he did as the king said.	mn83	4	8	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.9	The king gave the barber a prize village, then summoned the crown prince and said,	mn83	4	9	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.10	‘Dear prince, the messengers of the gods have shown themselves to me.	mn83	4	10	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.11	Grey hairs can be seen growing on my head.	mn83	4	11	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.12	I have enjoyed human pleasures.	mn83	4	12	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.13	Now it is time to seek heavenly pleasures.	mn83	4	13	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.14	Come, dear prince, rule the realm.	mn83	4	14	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.15	I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn83	4	15	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.16	For dear prince, you too will one day see grey hairs growing on your head. When this happens, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, you should shave off your hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn83	4	16	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.17	Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.	mn83	4	17	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.18	When a pair of men are living, the one who breaks such good practice is their final man.	mn83	4	18	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.19	Therefore I say to you,	mn83	4	19	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:4.20	“Keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final man.”’	mn83	4	20	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:5.1	And so, after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Maghadeva shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.	mn83	5	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:5.2	He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn83	5	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:5.3	He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn83	5	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:5.4	rejoicing …	mn83	5	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:5.5	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn83	5	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:6.1	For 84,000 years King Maghadeva played games as a child, for 84,000 years he acted as viceroy, for 84,000 years he ruled the realm, and for 84,000 years he led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove.	mn83	6	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:6.2	And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	mn83	6	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:7.1	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Maghadeva’s son addressed his barber,	mn83	7	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:7.2	‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’	mn83	7	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:7.3	And all unfolded as in the case of his father.	mn83	7	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:9.7	And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, Maghadeva’s son was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	mn83	9	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:10.1	And a lineage of 84,000 kings, sons of sons of King Maghadeva, shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove.	mn83	10	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:10.2	They meditated spreading a heart full of love …	mn83	10	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:11.1	compassion …	mn83	11	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:11.2	rejoicing …	mn83	11	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:11.3	equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn83	11	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:11.4	For 84,000 years they played games as a child, for 84,000 years they acted as viceroy, for 84,000 years they ruled the realm, and for 84,000 years they led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove.	mn83	11	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:11.5	And having developed the four divine meditations, when their bodies broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	mn83	11	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:12.1	Nimi was the last of those kings, a just and principled king, a great king who stood by his duty.	mn83	12	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:12.2	He justly treated brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	mn83	12	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:12.3	And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.	mn83	12	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.1	Once upon a time, Ānanda, while the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, this discussion came up among them:	mn83	13	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.2	‘The people of Videha are so fortunate, so very fortunate	mn83	13	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.3	to have Nimi as their king. He is a just and principled king, a great king who stands by his duty.	mn83	13	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.4	He justly treats brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	mn83	13	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.5	And he observes the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.’	mn83	13	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.6	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three,	mn83	13	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.7	‘Good fellows, would you like to see King Nimi?’	mn83	13	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.8	‘We would.’	mn83	13	8	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.9	Now at that time it was the fifteenth day sabbath, and King Nimi had bathed his head and was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath.	mn83	13	9	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.10	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from the thirty-three gods and reappeared in front of King Nimi.	mn83	13	10	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.11	He said to the king,	mn83	13	11	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.12	‘You’re fortunate, great king, so very fortunate.	mn83	13	12	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.13	The gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, where they were singing your praises.	mn83	13	13	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.18	They would like to see you.	mn83	13	18	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.19	I shall send a chariot harnessed with a thousand thoroughbreds for you, great king.	mn83	13	19	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.20	Mount the heavenly chariot, great king, without wavering!’	mn83	13	20	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.21	King Nimi consented with silence.	mn83	13	21	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:13.22	Then, knowing that the king had consented, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from King Nimi and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.	mn83	13	22	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.1	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali,	mn83	14	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.2	‘Come, dear Mātali, harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds. Then go to King Nimi and say,	mn83	14	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.3	“Great king, this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka, lord of gods.	mn83	14	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.4	Mount the heavenly chariot, great king, without wavering!”’	mn83	14	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.5	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. He did as Sakka asked, and said to the king,	mn83	14	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.6	‘Great king, this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka, lord of gods.	mn83	14	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.7	Mount the heavenly chariot, great king, without wavering!	mn83	14	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.8	But which way should we go—the way of those who experience the result of bad deeds, or the way of those who experience the result of good deeds?’	mn83	14	8	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:14.9	‘Take me both ways, Mātali.’	mn83	14	9	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.1	Mātali brought King Nimi to the Hall of Justice.	mn83	15	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.2	Sakka saw King Nimi coming off in the distance,	mn83	15	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.3	and said to him:	mn83	15	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.4	‘Come, great king!	mn83	15	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.5	Welcome, great king!	mn83	15	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.6	The gods of the thirty-three who wanted to see you were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, where they were singing your praises.	mn83	15	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.11	The gods of the thirty-three would like to see you.	mn83	15	11	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.12	Enjoy heavenly glory among the gods!’	mn83	15	12	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.13	‘Enough, good fellow. Send me back to Mithilā right away.	mn83	15	13	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.14	That way I shall justly treat brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	mn83	15	14	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:15.15	And I shall observe the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.’	mn83	15	15	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.1	Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali,	mn83	16	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.2	‘Come, dear Mātali, harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds and send King Nimi back to Mithilā right away.’	mn83	16	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.3	‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali, and did as Sakka asked.	mn83	16	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.4	And there King Nimi justly treated his people, and observed the sabbath.	mn83	16	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.5	Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Nimi addressed his barber,	mn83	16	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.6	‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’	mn83	16	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:16.7	And all unfolded as before.	mn83	16	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:17-19.7	And having developed the four divine meditations, when his body broke up, after death, King Nimi was reborn in a good place, a realm of divinity.	mn83	17-19	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:20.1	But King Nimi had a son named Kaḷārajanaka.	mn83	20	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:20.2	He didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn83	20	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:20.3	He broke that good practice.	mn83	20	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:20.4	He was their final man.	mn83	20	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.1	Ānanda, you might think,	mn83	21	1	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.2	‘Surely King Maghadeva, by whom that good practice was founded, must have been someone else at that time?’	mn83	21	2	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.3	But you should not see it like this.	mn83	21	3	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.4	I myself was King Maghadeva at that time.	mn83	21	4	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.5	I was the one who founded that good practice,	mn83	21	5	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.6	which was kept up by those who came after.	mn83	21	6	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.7	But that good practice doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the realm of divinity.	mn83	21	7	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.8	But now I have founded a good practice that does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	mn83	21	8	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.9	And what is that good practice?	mn83	21	9	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.10	It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:	mn83	21	10	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.11	right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.	mn83	21	11	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.12	This is the good practice I have now founded that leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.	mn83	21	12	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.13	Ānanda, I say to you:	mn83	21	13	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.14	‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’	mn83	21	14	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.15	When a pair of men are living, the one who breaks such good practice is their final man.	mn83	21	15	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.16	Ānanda, I say to you:	mn83	21	16	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.17	‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’”	mn83	21	17	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.18	That is what the Buddha said.	mn83	21	18	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn83:21.19	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn83	21	19	mn	83	About King Maghadeva
mn84:1.1	So I have heard.	mn84	1	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:1.2	At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.	mn84	1	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:2.1	King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard,	mn84	2	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Kaccāna is staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.	mn84	2	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn84	2	3	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:2.4	‘He is astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’	mn84	2	4	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:2.5	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn84	2	5	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:3.1	And then King Avantiputta had the finest carriages harnessed. He mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Madhurā to see Mahākaccāna.	mn84	3	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:3.2	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Mahākaccāna on foot. They exchanged greetings, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, the king sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:	mn84	3	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.1	“Worthy Kaccāna, the brahmins say:	mn84	4	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.2	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	mn84	4	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.3	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	mn84	4	3	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.4	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	mn84	4	4	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.5	Only brahmins are the true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	mn84	4	5	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:4.6	What does the worthy Kaccāna have to say about this?”	mn84	4	6	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.1	“Great king, that’s just hearsay in the world.	mn84	5	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.6	And here’s a way to understand that it’s just hearsay in the world.	mn84	5	6	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.9	What do you think, great king?	mn84	5	9	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.10	Suppose an aristocrat prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”	mn84	5	10	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.14	“There would, worthy Kaccāna.”	mn84	5	14	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.18	“What do you think, great king?	mn84	5	18	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.19	Suppose a brahmin …	mn84	5	19	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.27	a peasant …	mn84	5	27	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.35	a menial prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be menials, aristocrats, brahmins, and peasants who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”	mn84	5	35	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.39	“There would, worthy Kaccāna.”	mn84	5	39	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.43	“What do you think, great king?	mn84	5	43	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.44	If this is so, are the four classes equal or not?	mn84	5	44	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.45	Or how do you see this?”	mn84	5	45	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.46	“Certainly, worthy Kaccāna, in this case these four classes are equal.	mn84	5	46	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.47	I can’t see any difference between them.”	mn84	5	47	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:5.48	“And here’s another way to understand that the claims of the brahmins are just hearsay in the world.	mn84	5	48	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.1	What do you think, great king?	mn84	6	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.2	Take an aristocrat who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct; uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and is covetous, malicious, and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, would they be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell, or not?	mn84	6	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.3	Or how do you see this?”	mn84	6	3	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.4	“Such an aristocrat would be reborn in a bad place.	mn84	6	4	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.5	That’s what I think, but I’ve also heard it from the perfected ones.”	mn84	6	5	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.6	“Good, good, great king!	mn84	6	6	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.7	It’s good that you think so, and it’s good that you’ve heard it from the perfected ones.	mn84	6	7	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.8	What do you think, great king?	mn84	6	8	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.9	Take a brahmin …	mn84	6	9	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.10	a peasant …	mn84	6	10	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:6.11	a menial who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct; uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and is covetous, malicious, and has wrong view.

mn84:7.1	What do you think, great king?	mn84	7	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:7.2	Take an aristocrat who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.

mn84:7.8	What do you think, great king?	mn84	7	8	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:7.9	Take a brahmin, peasant, or menial who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, with right view. When their body breaks up, after death, would they be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or not?	mn84	7	9	mn	84	At Madhurā

mn84:7.18	“Certainly, worthy Kaccāna, in this case these four classes are equal.	mn84	7	18	mn	84	At Madhurā

mn84:8.2	Take an aristocrat who breaks into houses, plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, commits highway robbery, and commits adultery. Suppose your men arrest him and present him to you, saying:	mn84	8	2	mn	84	At Madhurā

mn84:8.6	“I would have him executed, fined, or banished, or dealt with as befits the crime.	mn84	8	6	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:8.7	Why is that?	mn84	8	7	mn	84	At Madhurā

mn84:10.1	When he had spoken, King Avantiputta of Madhurā said to Mahākaccāna,	mn84	10	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.2	“Excellent, worthy Kaccāna! Excellent!	mn84	10	2	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the worthy Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn84	10	3	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Kaccāna, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn84	10	4	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn84	10	5	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.6	“Great king, don’t go for refuge to me.	mn84	10	6	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.7	You should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.”	mn84	10	7	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.8	“But where is that Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	mn84	10	8	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:10.9	“Great king, the Buddha has already become fully quenched.”	mn84	10	9	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:11.1	“Worthy Kaccāna, if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues, or twenty, or even up to a hundred leagues away, I’d go a hundred leagues to see him.	mn84	11	1	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:11.4	But since the Buddha has become fully quenched, I go for refuge to that fully quenched Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn84	11	4	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn84:11.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn84	11	5	mn	84	At Madhurā
mn85:1.1	So I have heard.	mn85	1	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	mn85	1	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:2.1	Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.	mn85	2	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:3.1	Then Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputta,	mn85	3	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:3.2	“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn85	3	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:3.4	And then ask him whether he	mn85	3	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:3.5	might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	mn85	3	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:4.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked, and	mn85	4	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:4.6	the Buddha consented with silence.	mn85	4	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:4.7	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said,	mn85	4	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:4.8	“I gave your message to the worthy Gotama,	mn85	4	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:4.12	and he accepted.”	mn85	4	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:5.1	And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta,	mn85	5	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:5.2	“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and announce the time, saying,	mn85	5	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:5.3	‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’”	mn85	5	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:5.4	“Yes, worthy sir,” Sañjikāputta replied, and he did as he was asked.	mn85	5	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:6.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.	mn85	6	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.1	Now at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the Buddha.	mn85	7	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.2	Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn85	7	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.3	he went out to greet him. After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first, he approached the Pink Lotus longhouse.	mn85	7	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.4	But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase.	mn85	7	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.5	Then Prince Bodhi said to him,	mn85	7	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.6	“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!	mn85	7	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.7	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn85	7	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.8	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.	mn85	7	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.9	For a second time …	mn85	7	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.10	and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him,	mn85	7	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.11	“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!	mn85	7	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.12	It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn85	7	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.13	Then the Buddha glanced at Venerable Ānanda.	mn85	7	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.14	So Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi,	mn85	7	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.15	“Fold up the cloth, Prince.	mn85	7	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.16	The Buddha will not step upon white cloth.	mn85	7	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:7.17	The Realized One has sympathy for future generations.”	mn85	7	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:8.1	So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse.	mn85	8	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:8.2	Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn85	8	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:9.1	Then Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn85	9	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:9.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side,	mn85	9	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:9.3	and said to him,	mn85	9	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:9.4	“Sir, this is what I think:	mn85	9	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:9.5	‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’”	mn85	9	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:10.1	“Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought:	mn85	10	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:10.2	‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’	mn85	10	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.1	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn85	11	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.2	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn85	11	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.3	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn85	11	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.4	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	mn85	11	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.5	‘Stay, venerable.	mn85	11	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.6	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn85	11	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.7	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn85	11	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.8	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn85	11	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.9	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	11	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.10	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn85	11	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:11.11	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn85	11	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn85	12	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	mn85	12	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.3	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	mn85	12	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	12	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.5	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	mn85	12	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.6	energy,	mn85	12	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.7	mindfulness,	mn85	12	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.8	immersion,	mn85	12	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn85	12	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	mn85	12	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn85	12	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn85	12	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	mn85	12	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.14	‘I have, reverend.’	mn85	12	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn85	12	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn85	12	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn85	12	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.18	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn85	12	18	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	mn85	12	19	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.20	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	mn85	12	20	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.21	I am like you and you are like me.	mn85	12	21	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.22	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	mn85	12	22	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.23	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	mn85	12	23	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.24	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	12	24	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	mn85	12	25	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn85	12	26	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.27	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn85	12	27	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.28	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn85	12	28	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.29	Uddaka replied,	mn85	12	29	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.30	‘Stay, venerable.	mn85	12	30	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.31	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn85	12	31	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.32	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn85	12	32	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.33	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn85	12	33	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.34	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	12	34	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.35	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn85	12	35	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:12.36	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn85	12	36	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.1	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn85	13	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.2	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	mn85	13	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.3	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn85	13	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	13	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.5	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	mn85	13	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.6	energy,	mn85	13	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.7	mindfulness,	mn85	13	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.8	immersion,	mn85	13	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn85	13	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	mn85	13	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn85	13	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.12	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn85	13	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.13	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	mn85	13	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.14	‘He had, reverend.’	mn85	13	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn85	13	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn85	13	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn85	13	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.18	So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn85	13	18	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	mn85	13	19	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.20	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	mn85	13	20	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.21	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	mn85	13	21	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.22	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	mn85	13	22	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.23	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with lofty praise.	mn85	13	23	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.24	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	13	24	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	mn85	13	25	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:13.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn85	13	26	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	mn85	14	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	mn85	14	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.3	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	14	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	mn85	14	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	mn85	14	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.6	So I sat down right there, thinking,	mn85	14	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:14.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	mn85	14	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:15.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	mn85	15	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.1	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	mn85	16	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.2	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn85	16	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.3	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn85	16	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.4	What do you think, Prince?	mn85	16	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.5	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn85	16	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.6	“No, sir.	mn85	16	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.7	Why is that?	mn85	16	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.8	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	mn85	16	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:16.9	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn85	16	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:17.1	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	mn85	17	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:17.4	This was the first example that occurred to me.	mn85	17	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	mn85	18	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn85	18	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn85	18	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn85	18	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.5	What do you think, Prince?	mn85	18	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn85	18	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.7	“No, sir.	mn85	18	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.8	Why is that?	mn85	18	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	mn85	18	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn85	18	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. But they haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	mn85	18	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:18.14	This was the second example that occurred to me.	mn85	18	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	mn85	19	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn85	19	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn85	19	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn85	19	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.5	What do you think, Prince?	mn85	19	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.6	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn85	19	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.7	“Yes, sir.	mn85	19	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.8	Why is that?	mn85	19	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	mn85	19	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. And they have internally given up and stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are capable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	mn85	19	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.13	This was the third example that occurred to me.	mn85	19	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:19.14	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	mn85	19	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	20	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	mn85	20	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.3	So that’s what I did,	mn85	20	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn85	20	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	mn85	20	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn85	20	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:20.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	20	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	21	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	mn85	21	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn85	21	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	mn85	21	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	mn85	21	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:21.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	21	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	22	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn85	22	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn85	22	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.4	But then strong winds ground my head,	mn85	22	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.5	like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.	mn85	22	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:22.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	22	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	23	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn85	23	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn85	23	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.4	But then I got a severe headache,	mn85	23	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.5	like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	mn85	23	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:23.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	23	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	24	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn85	24	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn85	24	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.4	But then strong winds carved up my belly,	mn85	24	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.5	like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn85	24	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:24.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	24	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	25	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn85	25	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.	mn85	25	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.4	But then there was an intense burning in my body,	mn85	25	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.5	like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	mn85	25	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:25.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn85	25	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.1	Then some deities saw me and said,	mn85	26	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	mn85	26	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.3	Others said,	mn85	26	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	mn85	26	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.5	Others said,	mn85	26	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:26.6	‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’	mn85	26	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	27	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.2	‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’	mn85	27	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.3	But deities came to me and said,	mn85	27	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	mn85	27	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	mn85	27	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.6	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	27	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.7	‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’	mn85	27	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:27.8	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	mn85	27	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	28	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	mn85	28	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.3	So that’s what I did,	mn85	28	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	mn85	28	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	mn85	28	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	mn85	28	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	mn85	28	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	mn85	28	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	mn85	28	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	mn85	28	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	mn85	28	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	mn85	28	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:28.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	mn85	28	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:29.1	Then some people saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	mn85	29	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:29.2	Some said, ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	mn85	29	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:29.3	Some said, ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	mn85	29	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:29.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	mn85	29	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:30.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	30	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:30.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	mn85	30	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:30.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, gruelling work.	mn85	30	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:30.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	mn85	30	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:31.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	31	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:31.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn85	31	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:31.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	mn85	31	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:31.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	mn85	31	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:31.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	mn85	31	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:32.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	32	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:32.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	mn85	32	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:32.3	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	32	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:32.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	mn85	32	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	33	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	mn85	33	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.3	So I ate some solid food.	mn85	33	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.4	Now at that time the group of five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	mn85	33	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.5	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	mn85	33	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.6	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	mn85	33	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:33.7	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	mn85	33	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.1	After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption …	mn85	34-37	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.2	second absorption …	mn85	34-37	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.3	third absorption …	mn85	34-37	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.4	fourth absorption.	mn85	34-37	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.5	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	mn85	34-37	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.6	I recollected many past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn85	34-37	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.7	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	mn85	34-37	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:34-37.8	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn85	34-37	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:38.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn85	38	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:38.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn85	38	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:39.1	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn85	39	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:40.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn85	40	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:40.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn85	40	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:40.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn85	40	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:41.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn85	41	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:41.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	mn85	41	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:41.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	mn85	41	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:42.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	mn85	42	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:42.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn85	42	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	43	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.2	‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.	mn85	43	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.3	But people like clinging, they love it and enjoy it.	mn85	43	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.4	It’s hard for them to see this topic; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.	mn85	43	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.5	It’s also hard for them to see this topic; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	mn85	43	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.6	And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’	mn85	43	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.7	And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:	mn85	43	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.8	‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,	mn85	43	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.9	enough with trying to explain it!	mn85	43	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.10	Those mired in greed and hate	mn85	43	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.11	can’t really understand this teaching.	mn85	43	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.12	It goes against the stream, subtle,	mn85	43	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.13	deep, obscure, and very fine.	mn85	43	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.14	Those besotted by greed cannot see,	mn85	43	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.15	for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’	mn85	43	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:43.16	And as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.	mn85	43	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.1	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing my train of thought, thought,	mn85	44	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.2	‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’	mn85	44	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.3	Then the divinity Sahampati, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me.	mn85	44	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.4	He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said,	mn85	44	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.5	‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!	mn85	44	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.6	There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	mn85	44	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.7	There will be those who understand the teaching!’	mn85	44	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.8	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	mn85	44	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.9	Then he went on to say:	mn85	44	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.10	‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past	mn85	44	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.11	an impure teaching thought up by the stained.	mn85	44	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.12	Fling open the door to freedom from death!	mn85	44	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.13	Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered.	mn85	44	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.14	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	mn85	44	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.15	you can see the people all around.	mn85	44	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.16	In just the same way, All-seer, so intelligent,	mn85	44	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.17	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	mn85	44	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.18	rid of sorrow, look upon the people	mn85	44	18	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.19	swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.	mn85	44	19	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.20	Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,	mn85	44	20	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.21	wander the world free of debt.	mn85	44	21	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.22	Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!	mn85	44	22	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:44.23	There will be those who understand!’	mn85	44	23	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.1	Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.	mn85	45	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.2	And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.	mn85	45	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.	mn85	45	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.5	Then I replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati:	mn85	45	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.6	‘Flung open are the doors to freedom from death!	mn85	45	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.7	Let those with ears to hear commit to faith.	mn85	45	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.8	Thinking it would be troublesome, Divinity, <j>I did not teach	mn85	45	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.9	the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among mankind.’	mn85	45	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:45.10	Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.	mn85	45	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	46	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn85	46	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	mn85	46	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	46	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.5	‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	mn85	46	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	mn85	46	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	mn85	46	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.8	But a deity came to me and said,	mn85	46	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.9	‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	mn85	46	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	mn85	46	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.11	‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’	mn85	46	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.12	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	46	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.13	‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.	mn85	46	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:46.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	mn85	46	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	47	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn85	47	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	mn85	47	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	47	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.5	‘That Uddaka son of Rāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.	mn85	47	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.6	Why don’t I teach him first of all?	mn85	47	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.7	He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’	mn85	47	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.8	But a deity came to me and said,	mn85	47	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.9	‘Sir, Uddaka son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’	mn85	47	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.10	And knowledge and vision arose in me,	mn85	47	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.11	‘Uddaka son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’	mn85	47	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.12	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	47	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.13	‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.	mn85	47	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:47.14	If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’	mn85	47	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	48	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.2	‘Who should I teach first of all?	mn85	48	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.3	Who will quickly understand the teaching?’	mn85	48	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	48	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.5	‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.	mn85	48	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.6	Why don’t I teach them first of all?’	mn85	48	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.7	Then it occurred to me,	mn85	48	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.8	‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’	mn85	48	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:48.9	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana.	mn85	48	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.1	So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I pleased, I set out for Varanasi.	mn85	49	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.2	While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me	mn85	49	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.3	and said,	mn85	49	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.4	‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	mn85	49	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.5	In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’	mn85	49	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.6	I replied to Upaka in verse:	mn85	49	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.7	‘I am the champion, the knower of all,	mn85	49	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.8	unsullied in the midst of all things.	mn85	49	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.9	I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.	mn85	49	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.10	Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?	mn85	49	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.11	I have no tutor.	mn85	49	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.12	There is no-one like me.	mn85	49	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.13	In the world with its gods,	mn85	49	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.14	I have no rival.	mn85	49	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.15	For in this world, I am the perfected one;	mn85	49	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.16	I am the supreme Teacher.	mn85	49	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.17	I alone am fully awakened,	mn85	49	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.18	cooled, quenched.	mn85	49	18	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.19	I am going to the city of Kāsi	mn85	49	19	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.20	to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.	mn85	49	20	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.21	In this world that is so blind,	mn85	49	21	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.22	I’ll beat the drum of freedom from death!’	mn85	49	22	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.23	‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’	mn85	49	23	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.24	‘The victors are those who, like me,	mn85	49	24	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.25	have reached the ending of defilements.	mn85	49	25	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.26	I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—	mn85	49	26	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.27	that’s why I’m a victor.’	mn85	49	27	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:49.28	When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.	mn85	49	28	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.1	Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Varanasi, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.	mn85	50	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.2	The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance	mn85	50	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.3	and stopped each other, saying,	mn85	50	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.4	‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.	mn85	50	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.5	We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.	mn85	50	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.6	But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’	mn85	50	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.7	Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.	mn85	50	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.8	Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.	mn85	50	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:50.9	But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.	mn85	50	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.1	So I said to them,	mn85	51	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.2	‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as “reverend”.	mn85	51	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.3	The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn85	51	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.4	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn85	51	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.5	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn85	51	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.6	But they said to me,	mn85	51	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.7	‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence?’	mn85	51	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.8	So I said to them,	mn85	51	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.9	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence.	mn85	51	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.10	The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn85	51	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.11	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn85	51	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.12	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn85	51	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.13	But for a second time they said to me,	mn85	51	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.14	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’	mn85	51	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.15	So for a second time I said to them,	mn85	51	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.16	‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’	mn85	51	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.20	But for a third time they said to me,	mn85	51	20	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:51.21	‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’	mn85	51	21	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.1	So I said to them,	mn85	52	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.2	‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’	mn85	52	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.3	‘No, sir.’	mn85	52	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.4	‘The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn85	52	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.5	Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved freedom from death! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.	mn85	52	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:52.6	By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’	mn85	52	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:53.1	I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.	mn85	53	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:53.2	Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.	mn85	53	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:53.3	Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	mn85	53	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:53.4	Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.	mn85	53	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:53.5	Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.	mn85	53	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:54.1	As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, they soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	mn85	54	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.1	When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,	mn85	55	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.2	“Sir, when a mendicant has the Realized One as trainer, how long would it take for them to realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life?”	mn85	55	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.3	“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn85	55	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.4	What do you think, prince?	mn85	55	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.5	Are you skilled in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”	mn85	55	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:55.6	“Yes, sir.”	mn85	55	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.1	“What do you think, prince?	mn85	56	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.2	Suppose a man were to come along thinking,	mn85	56	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.3	‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant.	mn85	56	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.4	I’ll train in that art under him.’	mn85	56	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.5	If he’s faithless,	mn85	56	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.6	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with faith.	mn85	56	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.7	If he’s unhealthy,	mn85	56	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.8	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with good health.	mn85	56	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.9	If he’s devious or deceitful,	mn85	56	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.10	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with honesty and integrity.	mn85	56	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.11	If he’s lazy,	mn85	56	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.12	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with energy.	mn85	56	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.13	If he’s stupid,	mn85	56	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.14	he wouldn’t achieve what he could with wisdom.	mn85	56	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.15	What do you think, prince?	mn85	56	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.16	Could that man still train under you in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”	mn85	56	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:56.17	“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he couldn’t train under me, let alone all five.”	mn85	56	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.1	“What do you think, prince?	mn85	57	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.2	Suppose a man were to come along thinking,	mn85	57	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.3	‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant.	mn85	57	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.4	I’ll train in that art under him.’	mn85	57	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.5	If he’s faithful,	mn85	57	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.6	he’d achieve what he could with faith.	mn85	57	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.7	If he’s healthy,	mn85	57	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.8	he’d achieve what he could with good health.	mn85	57	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.9	If he’s honest and has integrity,	mn85	57	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.10	he’d achieve what he could with honesty and integrity.	mn85	57	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.11	If he’s energetic,	mn85	57	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.12	he’d achieve what he could with energy.	mn85	57	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.13	If he’s wise,	mn85	57	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.14	he’d achieve what he could with wisdom.	mn85	57	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.15	What do you think, prince?	mn85	57	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.16	Could that man still train under you in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”	mn85	57	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:57.17	“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he could train under me, let alone all five.”	mn85	57	17	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.1	“In the same way, prince, there are these five factors that support meditation.	mn85	58	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.2	What five?	mn85	58	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.3	It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	mn85	58	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn85	58	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.5	They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.	mn85	58	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.6	They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.	mn85	58	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.7	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	mn85	58	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.8	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	mn85	58	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:58.9	These are the five factors that support meditation.	mn85	58	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.1	When a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could	mn85	59	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.2	realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven years.	mn85	59	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.3	Let alone seven years,	mn85	59	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.4	they could	mn85	59	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.5	realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in six years,	mn85	59	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.10	or as little as one year.	mn85	59	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.11	Let alone one year,	mn85	59	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.12	when a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could	mn85	59	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.13	realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven months,	mn85	59	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.36	or as little as one day.	mn85	59	36	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.37	Let alone one day,	mn85	59	37	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:59.38	when a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could be instructed In the evening and achieve distinction in the morning, or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the evening.”	mn85	59	38	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:60.1	When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,	mn85	60	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:60.2	“Oh, the Buddha! Oh, the teaching! Oh, how well explained is the teaching!	mn85	60	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:60.3	For someone could be instructed in the evening and achieve distinction in the morning, or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the evening.”	mn85	60	3	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.1	When he said this, Sañjikāputta said to Prince Bodhi,	mn85	61	1	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.2	“Though the worthy Bodhi speaks like this,	mn85	61	2	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.4	you don’t go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.”	mn85	61	4	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.5	“Don’t say that, dear Sañjikāputta, don’t say that!	mn85	61	5	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.6	I have heard and learned this in the presence of my lady mother.	mn85	61	6	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.7	This one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	mn85	61	7	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.8	Then my pregnant lady mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn85	61	8	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.9	‘Sir, the prince or princess in my womb goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn85	61	9	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.10	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember them as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’	mn85	61	10	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.11	Another time the Buddha was staying here in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.	mn85	61	11	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.12	Then my nursemaid, carrying me on her hip, went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	mn85	61	12	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.13	‘Sir, this Prince Bodhi goes for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn85	61	13	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.14	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember him as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’	mn85	61	14	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.15	Now for a third time I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn85	61	15	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn85:61.16	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn85	61	16	mn	85	With Prince Bodhi
mn86:1.1	So I have heard.	mn86	1	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn86	1	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:2.1	Now at that time in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He was violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	mn86	2	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:2.2	He laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	mn86	2	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:2.3	He was constantly murdering humans, and he wore their fingers as a necklace.	mn86	2	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn86	3	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.2	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, he walked down the road that led to Aṅgulimāla.	mn86	3	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.3	The cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw him on the road,	mn86	3	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.4	and said to him,	mn86	3	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.5	“Don’t take this road, ascetic.	mn86	3	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.6	On this road there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	mn86	3	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.7	He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	mn86	3	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.8	He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.	mn86	3	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.9	People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.	mn86	3	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.10	Still they meet their end by Aṅgulimāla’s hand.”	mn86	3	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.11	But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.	mn86	3	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.12	For a second time …	mn86	3	12	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:3.13	and a third time, they urged the Buddha to turn back.	mn86	3	13	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.1	But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.	mn86	4	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.2	The bandit Aṅgulimāla saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn86	4	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.3	and thought,	mn86	4	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.4	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn86	4	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.5	People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.	mn86	4	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.6	Still they meet their end by my hand.	mn86	4	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.7	But still this ascetic comes along alone and unaccompanied, like a conqueror.	mn86	4	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:4.8	Why don’t I take his life?”	mn86	4	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.1	Then Aṅgulimāla donned his sword and shield, fastened his bow and arrows, and followed behind the Buddha.	mn86	5	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.2	But the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him no matter how hard he tried, even though the Buddha kept walking at a normal speed.	mn86	5	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.3	Then Aṅgulimāla thought,	mn86	5	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.4	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn86	5	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.5	Previously, even when I’ve chased a speeding elephant, horse, chariot or deer, I’ve always caught up with them.	mn86	5	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.6	But I can’t catch up with this ascetic no matter how hard I try, even though he’s walking at a normal speed.”	mn86	5	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.7	He stood still and said,	mn86	5	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.8	“Stop, stop, ascetic!”	mn86	5	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.9	“I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.”	mn86	5	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.10	Then Aṅgulimāla thought,	mn86	5	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.11	“These ascetics who follow the Sakyan speak the truth.	mn86	5	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.12	Yet while walking the ascetic Gotama says:	mn86	5	12	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.13	‘I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.’	mn86	5	13	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:5.14	Why don’t I ask him about this?”	mn86	5	14	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.1	Then he addressed the Buddha in verse:	mn86	6	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.2	“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’	mn86	6	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.3	And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.	mn86	6	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.4	I’m asking you this, ascetic:	mn86	6	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.5	how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”	mn86	6	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.6	“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—	mn86	6	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.7	I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.	mn86	6	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.8	But you can’t stop yourself <j>from harming living creatures;	mn86	6	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.9	that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”	mn86	6	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.10	“Oh, at long last a renowned great seer,	mn86	6	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.11	an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood.	mn86	6	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.12	Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,	mn86	6	12	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.13	I shall live without evil.”	mn86	6	13	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.14	With these words, <j>the bandit hurled his sword and weapons	mn86	6	14	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.15	down a cliff into an abyss.	mn86	6	15	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.16	He venerated the Holy One’s feet,	mn86	6	16	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.17	and asked him for the going forth right away.	mn86	6	17	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.18	Then the Buddha, the compassionate great seer,	mn86	6	18	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.19	the teacher of the world with its gods,	mn86	6	19	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.20	said to him, “Come, monk!”	mn86	6	20	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:6.21	And with that he became a monk.	mn86	6	21	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:7.1	Then the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monk.	mn86	7	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,	mn86	7	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:7.3	where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn86	7	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:8.1	Now at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadi’s royal compound making a dreadful racket,	mn86	8	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:8.2	“In your realm, Your Majesty, there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	mn86	8	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:8.3	He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.	mn86	8	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:8.4	He is constantly murdering humans, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.	mn86	8	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:8.5	Your Majesty must put a stop to him!”	mn86	8	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:9.1	Then King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horses,	mn86	9	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:9.2	heading for the monastery.	mn86	9	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:9.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn86	9	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:9.4	“What is it, great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you, or the Licchavis of Vesālī, or some other opposing ruler?”	mn86	9	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:10.1	“No, sir.	mn86	10	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:10.2	In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. …	mn86	10	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:10.5	I shall put a stop to him.”	mn86	10	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:11.1	“But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying; that he was eating in one part of the day, and was chaste, ethical, and of good character. What would you do to him?”	mn86	11	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:11.2	“I would bow to him, rise in his presence, or offer him a seat. I’d invite him to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize his lawful guarding and protection.	mn86	11	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:11.3	But sir, how could such an immoral, evil man ever have such virtue and restraint?”	mn86	11	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.1	Now at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the Buddha.	mn86	12	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.2	Then the Buddha pointed with his right arm and said to the king,	mn86	12	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.3	“Great king, this is Aṅgulimāla.”	mn86	12	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.4	Then the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.	mn86	12	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.5	Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,	mn86	12	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.6	“Do not fear, great king. You have nothing to fear from him.”	mn86	12	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.7	Then the king’s fear died down.	mn86	12	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.8	Then the king went over to Aṅgulimāla and said,	mn86	12	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.9	“Sir, is the master really Aṅgulimāla?”	mn86	12	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.10	“Yes, great king.”	mn86	12	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.11	“What clans were your father and mother from?”	mn86	12	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.12	“My father was a Gagga, and my mother a Mantāṇī.”	mn86	12	12	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.13	“Sir, may Master Gagga son of Mantāṇī be happy.	mn86	12	13	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:12.14	I’ll make sure that you’re provided with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”	mn86	12	14	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.1	But at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, and owned just three robes.	mn86	13	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.2	So he said to the king,	mn86	13	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.3	“Enough, great king. My robes are complete.”	mn86	13	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.4	Then the king went back to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn86	13	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn86	13	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.6	How the Buddha tames those who are wild, pacifies those who are violent, and extinguishes those who are unquenched!	mn86	13	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.7	For I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword, but the Buddha tamed him without rod or sword.	mn86	13	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.8	Well, now, sir, I must go.	mn86	13	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.9	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn86	13	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.10	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	mn86	13	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:13.11	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn86	13	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.1	Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn86	14	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.2	Then as he was wandering indiscriminately for almsfood he saw a woman undergoing a distressing obstructed labor.	mn86	14	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.3	Seeing this, it occurred to him,	mn86	14	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.4	“Oh, beings undergo such travail!	mn86	14	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.5	Oh, beings undergo such travail!”	mn86	14	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:14.6	Then after wandering for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said to him,	mn86	14	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.1	“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:	mn86	15	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.2	‘Ever since I was born, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”	mn86	15	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.3	“But sir, wouldn’t that be telling a deliberate lie?	mn86	15	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.4	For I have intentionally killed many living creatures.”	mn86	15	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.5	“In that case, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:	mn86	15	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.6	‘Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”	mn86	15	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.7	“Yes, sir,” replied Aṅgulimāla. He went to that woman and said:	mn86	15	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.8	“Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.”	mn86	15	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:15.9	Then that woman was safe, and so was her baby.	mn86	15	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:16.1	Then Aṅgulimāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn86	16	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:16.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn86	16	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:16.3	And Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfected.	mn86	16	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.1	Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn86	17	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.2	Now at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla, someone else threw a stick, and someone else threw gravel.	mn86	17	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.3	Then Aṅgulimāla—with cracked head, bleeding, his bowl broken, and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha.	mn86	17	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.4	The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,	mn86	17	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.5	and said to him,	mn86	17	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.6	“Endure it, brahmin! Endure it, brahmin!	mn86	17	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:17.7	You’re experiencing in this very life the result of deeds that might have caused you to be tormented in hell for many years, many hundreds or thousands of years.”	mn86	17	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.1	Later, Venerable Aṅgulimāla was experiencing the bliss of release while in private retreat.	mn86	18	1	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.2	On that occasion he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	mn86	18	2	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.3	“He who once was heedless,	mn86	18	3	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.4	but turned to heedfulness,	mn86	18	4	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.5	lights up the world,	mn86	18	5	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.6	like the moon freed from clouds.	mn86	18	6	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.7	Someone whose bad deed	mn86	18	7	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.8	is supplanted by the good,	mn86	18	8	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.9	lights up the world,	mn86	18	9	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.10	like the moon freed from clouds.	mn86	18	10	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.11	A young mendicant	mn86	18	11	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.12	devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,	mn86	18	12	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.13	lights up the world,	mn86	18	13	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.14	like the moon freed from clouds.	mn86	18	14	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.15	May even my enemies <j>hear a Dhamma talk!	mn86	18	15	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.16	May even my enemies <j>devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching!	mn86	18	16	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.17	May even my enemies associate with those good men	mn86	18	17	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.18	who establish others in the Dhamma!	mn86	18	18	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.19	May even my enemies <j>hear Dhamma at the right time,	mn86	18	19	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.20	from those who teach acceptance,	mn86	18	20	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.21	praising acquiescence;	mn86	18	21	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.22	and may they follow that path!	mn86	18	22	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.23	For then they’d never wish harm	mn86	18	23	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.24	upon myself or others.	mn86	18	24	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.25	Having arrived at ultimate peace,	mn86	18	25	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.26	they’d look after creatures firm and frail.	mn86	18	26	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.27	For irrigators guide the water,	mn86	18	27	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.28	and fletchers straighten arrows;	mn86	18	28	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.29	carpenters carve timber—	mn86	18	29	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.30	but the astute tame themselves.	mn86	18	30	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.31	Some tame by using the rod,	mn86	18	31	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.32	some with goads, and some with whips.	mn86	18	32	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.33	But the unaffected one tamed me	mn86	18	33	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.34	without rod or sword.	mn86	18	34	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.35	My name is ‘Harmless’,	mn86	18	35	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.36	though I used to be harmful.	mn86	18	36	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.37	The name I bear today is true,	mn86	18	37	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.38	for I do no harm to anyone.	mn86	18	38	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.39	I used to be a bandit,	mn86	18	39	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.40	the notorious Aṅgulimāla.	mn86	18	40	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.41	Swept away in a great flood,	mn86	18	41	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.42	I went to the Buddha as a refuge.	mn86	18	42	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.43	I used to have blood on my hands,	mn86	18	43	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.44	the notorious Aṅgulimāla.	mn86	18	44	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.45	See the refuge I’ve found—	mn86	18	45	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.46	the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.	mn86	18	46	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.47	I’ve done many of the sort of deeds	mn86	18	47	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.48	that lead to a bad destination.	mn86	18	48	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.49	The result of my deeds has already struck me,	mn86	18	49	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.50	so I enjoy my food free of debt.	mn86	18	50	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.51	Fools and simpletons	mn86	18	51	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.52	devote themselves to negligence.	mn86	18	52	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.53	But the wise protect diligence	mn86	18	53	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.54	as their best treasure.	mn86	18	54	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.55	Don’t devote yourself to negligence,	mn86	18	55	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.56	or delight in erotic intimacy.	mn86	18	56	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.57	For if you’re diligent and practice absorption,	mn86	18	57	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.58	you’ll attain abundant happiness.	mn86	18	58	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.59	It was welcome, not unwelcome,	mn86	18	59	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.60	the advice I got was good.	mn86	18	60	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.61	Of the well-explained teachings,	mn86	18	61	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.62	I arrived at the best.	mn86	18	62	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.63	It was welcome, not unwelcome,	mn86	18	63	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.64	the advice I got was good.	mn86	18	64	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.65	I’ve attained the three knowledges	mn86	18	65	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn86:18.66	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”	mn86	18	66	mn	86	With Aṅgulimāla
mn87:1.1	So I have heard.	mn87	1	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn87	1	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:2.1	Now at that time a certain householder’s dear and beloved only child passed away.	mn87	2	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:2.2	After their death he didn’t feel like working or eating.	mn87	2	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:2.3	He would go to the cremation ground and wail,	mn87	2	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:2.4	“Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?”	mn87	2	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.1	Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn87	3	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.2	“Your faculties, householder, are those of one who is unstable in their own mind; there is a deterioration in your faculties.”	mn87	3	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.3	“And how, sir, could there be no deterioration of my faculties?	mn87	3	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.4	For my dear and beloved only child has passed away.	mn87	3	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.5	Since their death I haven’t felt like working or eating.	mn87	3	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.6	I go to the cremation ground and wail:	mn87	3	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.7	‘Where are you, my only child? Where are you, my only child?’”	mn87	3	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.8	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!	mn87	3	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.9	For our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”	mn87	3	9	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.10	“Sir, who on earth could ever think such a thing!	mn87	3	10	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.12	For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”	mn87	3	12	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:3.13	Disagreeing with the Buddha’s statement, rejecting it, he got up from his seat and left.	mn87	3	13	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:4.1	Now at that time several gamblers were playing dice not far from the Buddha.	mn87	4	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:4.2	That householder approached them and told them what had happened.	mn87	4	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:4.17	“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!	mn87	4	17	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:4.18	For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness.”	mn87	4	18	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:4.19	Thinking, “The gamblers and I are in agreement,” the householder left.	mn87	4	19	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.1	Eventually that topic of discussion reached the royal compound.	mn87	5	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.2	Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā,	mn87	5	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.3	“Mallika, your ascetic Gotama said this:	mn87	5	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.4	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”	mn87	5	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.5	“If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.”	mn87	5	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.6	“No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Mallikā agrees with him:	mn87	5	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.7	‘If that’s what the Buddha said, great king, then that’s how it is.’	mn87	5	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.8	You’re just like a pupil who agrees with everything their tutor says.	mn87	5	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:5.12	Go away, Mallikā, get out of here!”	mn87	5	12	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.1	Then Queen Mallikā addressed the brahmin Nāḷijaṅgha,	mn87	6	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.2	“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn87	6	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.4	And then say:	mn87	6	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.5	‘Sir, did the Buddha make this statement:	mn87	6	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.6	“Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress”?’	mn87	6	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.7	Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me.	mn87	6	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.8	For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”	mn87	6	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.9	“Yes, ma’am,” he replied. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn87	6	9	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.10	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,	mn87	6	10	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.11	“Worthy Gotama, Queen Mallikā bows with her head to your feet. She asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn87	6	11	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.12	And she asks whether	mn87	6	12	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.13	the Buddha made this statement:	mn87	6	13	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:6.14	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”	mn87	6	14	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:7.1	“That’s right, brahmin, that’s right!	mn87	7	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:7.2	For our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn87	7	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:8.1	And here’s a way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn87	8	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:8.2	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman’s mother passed away.	mn87	8	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:8.3	And because of that she went mad and lost her mind. She went from street to street and from square to square saying,	mn87	8	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:8.4	‘Has anyone seen my mother? Has anyone seen my mother?’	mn87	8	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.1	And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn87	9-14	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.2	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman’s father …	mn87	9-14	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.3	brother …	mn87	9-14	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.4	sister …	mn87	9-14	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.5	son …	mn87	9-14	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.6	daughter …	mn87	9-14	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.7	husband passed away.	mn87	9-14	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.8	And because of that she went mad and lost her mind. She went from street to street and from square to square saying,	mn87	9-14	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:9-14.9	‘Has anyone seen my husband? Has anyone seen my husband?’	mn87	9-14	9	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.1	And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn87	15-21	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.2	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain man’s mother …	mn87	15-21	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.6	father …	mn87	15-21	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.7	brother …	mn87	15-21	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved

mn87:15-21.10	daughter …	mn87	15-21	10	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.11	wife passed away.	mn87	15-21	11	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.12	And because of that he went mad and lost his mind. He went from street to street and from square to square saying,	mn87	15-21	12	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.13	‘Has anyone seen my wife? Has anyone seen my wife?’	mn87	15-21	13	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:15-21.14	And here’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.	mn87	15-21	14	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.1	Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman went to live with her relative’s family.	mn87	22	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.2	But her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another,	mn87	22	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.3	who she didn’t want.	mn87	22	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.4	So she told her husband about this.	mn87	22	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.7	But he cut her in two and disemboweled himself, thinking,	mn87	22	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.8	‘We shall be together after death.’	mn87	22	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:22.9	That’s another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”	mn87	22	9	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:23.1	Then Nāḷijaṅgha the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat, went to Queen Mallikā, and told her of all they had discussed. Then Queen Mallikā approached King Pasenadi and said to him,	mn87	23	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:24.1	“What do you think, great king?	mn87	24	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:24.2	Do you love Princess Vajirī?”	mn87	24	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:24.3	“Indeed I do, Mallikā.”	mn87	24	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:24.4	“What do you think, great king?	mn87	24	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:24.5	If she were to decay and perish, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise in you?”	mn87	24	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved

mn87:25.1	What do you think, great king?	mn87	25	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:25.2	Do you love Lady Vāsabhā? …	mn87	25	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:26.1	Do you love your son, General Viḍūḍabha? …	mn87	26	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:27.1	Do you love me?”	mn87	27	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:27.2	“Indeed I do love you, Mallikā.”	mn87	27	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:27.3	“What do you think, great king?	mn87	27	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved

mn87:27.7	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’	mn87	27	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.1	What do you think, great king?	mn87	28	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.2	Do you love the realms of Kāsi and Kosala?”	mn87	28	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.3	“Indeed I do, Mallikā.	mn87	28	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.4	It’s due to the bounty of Kāsi and Kosala that we use sandalwood imported from Kāsi and wear garlands, fragrance, and makeup.”	mn87	28	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.5	“What do you think, great king?	mn87	28	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.6	If these realms were to decay and perish, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise in you?”	mn87	28	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.7	“If they were to decay and perish, my life would fall apart. How could sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress not arise in me?”	mn87	28	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.8	“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:	mn87	28	8	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:28.9	‘Our loved ones are a source of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.’”	mn87	28	9	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.1	“It’s incredible, Mallikā, it’s amazing,	mn87	29	1	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.2	how far the Buddha sees with penetrating wisdom, it seems to me.	mn87	29	2	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.3	Come, Mallikā, rinse my hands.”	mn87	29	3	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.4	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	mn87	29	4	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.5	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn87	29	5	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.6	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn87	29	6	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn87:29.7	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	mn87	29	7	mn	87	Born From the Beloved
mn88:1.1	So I have heard.	mn88	1	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn88	1	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:2.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn88	2	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:2.2	He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, for the day’s meditation.	mn88	2	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:3.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the Single Lotus Elephant and drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day.	mn88	3	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:3.2	He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance	mn88	3	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:3.3	and said to the chief minister Sirivaḍḍha,	mn88	3	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:3.4	“My dear Sirivaḍḍha, isn’t that Venerable Ānanda?”	mn88	3	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:3.5	“Indeed it is, great king.”	mn88	3	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:4.1	Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,	mn88	4	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:4.2	“Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	mn88	4	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:4.3	‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head at your feet.’	mn88	4	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:4.4	And then say:	mn88	4	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:4.5	‘Sir, if you have no urgent business, please wait an hour out of sympathy.’”	mn88	4	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:5.1	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	mn88	5	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:6.1	Ānanda consented with silence.	mn88	6	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:6.2	Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,	mn88	6	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:6.3	“Sir, if you have no urgent business, it would be nice of you to go to the bank of the Aciravatī river out of sympathy.”	mn88	6	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.1	Ānanda consented with silence.	mn88	7	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.2	He went to the river bank and sat at the root of a certain tree on a seat spread out.	mn88	7	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.3	Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,	mn88	7	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.4	“Here, Venerable Ānanda, sit on this elephant rug.”	mn88	7	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.5	“Enough, great king,	mn88	7	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.6	you sit on it.	mn88	7	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:7.7	I’m sitting on my own seat.”	mn88	7	7	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:8.1	So the king sat down on the seat spread out,	mn88	8	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:8.2	and said,	mn88	8	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:8.3	“Honorable Ānanda, would the Buddha engage in the sort of behavior—by way of body, speech, or mind—that is faulted by ascetics and brahmins?”	mn88	8	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:8.4	“No, great king, the Buddha would not engage in the sort of behavior that is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	mn88	8	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:9.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn88	9	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:9.2	For I couldn’t fully express the question, but Venerable Ānanda’s answer completed it for me.	mn88	9	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:9.3	I don’t believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by incompetent fools, without examining or scrutinizing, is the most important thing.	mn88	9	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:9.4	Rather, I believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by competent and intelligent people after examining and scrutinizing is the most important thing.	mn88	9	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.1	But Honorable Ānanda, what kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”	mn88	10	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.2	“Unskillful behavior.”	mn88	10	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.3	“But what kind of bodily behavior is unskillful?”	mn88	10	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.4	“Blameworthy behavior.”	mn88	10	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.5	“But what kind of bodily behavior is blameworthy?”	mn88	10	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.6	“Hurtful behavior.”	mn88	10	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.7	“But what kind of bodily behavior is hurtful?”	mn88	10	7	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.8	“Behavior that results in suffering.”	mn88	10	8	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.9	“But what kind of bodily behavior results in suffering?”	mn88	10	9	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.10	“Bodily behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,	mn88	10	10	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.11	and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.	mn88	10	11	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:10.12	That kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	mn88	10	12	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:11.1	“But what kind of verbal behavior …	mn88	11	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:11.2	mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …	mn88	11	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:12.4	“Mental behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,	mn88	12	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:12.5	and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.	mn88	12	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:12.6	That kind of mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	mn88	12	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:13.1	“Sir, does the Buddha praise giving up all these unskillful things?”	mn88	13	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:13.2	“Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”	mn88	13	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.1	“But sir, what kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”	mn88	14	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.2	“Skillful behavior.”	mn88	14	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.3	“But what kind of bodily behavior is skillful?”	mn88	14	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.4	“Blameless behavior.”	mn88	14	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.5	“But what kind of bodily behavior is blameless?”	mn88	14	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.6	“Pleasing behavior.”	mn88	14	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.7	“But what kind of bodily behavior is pleasing?”	mn88	14	7	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.8	“Behavior that results in happiness.”	mn88	14	8	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.9	“But what kind of bodily behavior results in happiness?”	mn88	14	9	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.10	“Bodily behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,	mn88	14	10	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.11	and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.	mn88	14	11	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:14.12	That kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	mn88	14	12	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:15.1	“But what kind of verbal behavior …	mn88	15	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:15.2	mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …	mn88	15	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:16.6	“Mental behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,	mn88	16	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:16.7	and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.	mn88	16	7	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:16.8	That kind of mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”	mn88	16	8	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:17.1	“Sir, does the Buddha praise embracing all these skillful things?”	mn88	17	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:17.2	“Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”	mn88	17	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn88	18	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.2	How well this was said by Venerable Ānanda!	mn88	18	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.3	I’m delighted and satisfied with what you’ve expressed so well.	mn88	18	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.4	So much so that	mn88	18	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.5	if an elephant-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.	mn88	18	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.6	If a horse-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.	mn88	18	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.7	If a prize village was suitable for you, I would give you one.	mn88	18	7	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.8	But, sir, I know that	mn88	18	8	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.9	these things are not suitable for you.	mn88	18	9	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.10	This imported cloth was sent to me by King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, packed in a parasol case. It’s exactly sixteen measures long and eight wide.	mn88	18	10	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.11	May Venerable Ānanda please accept it out of sympathy.”	mn88	18	11	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:18.12	“Enough, great king. My three robes are complete.”	mn88	18	12	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.1	“Sir, we have both seen this river Aciravatī	mn88	19	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.2	when it has rained heavily in the mountains, and the river overflows both its banks.	mn88	19	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.3	In the same way, Venerable Ānanda can make a set of three robes for himself from this imported cloak,	mn88	19	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.4	and you can share your old robes with your fellow monks.	mn88	19	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.5	In this way my religious donation will come to overflow, it seems to me.	mn88	19	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:19.6	Please accept the imported cloth.”	mn88	19	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.1	So Ānanda accepted it.	mn88	20	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.2	Then King Pasenadi said to him,	mn88	20	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.3	“Well, now, sir, I must go.	mn88	20	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.4	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn88	20	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.5	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	mn88	20	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:20.6	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what Ānanda said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Ānanda, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn88	20	6	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:21.1	Soon after he left, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	mn88	21	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:21.2	and told him what had happened.	mn88	21	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:21.3	He presented the cloth to the Buddha.	mn88	21	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:22.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn88	22	1	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:22.2	“Mendicants, King Pasenadi is lucky, so very lucky,	mn88	22	2	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:22.3	to get to see Ānanda and pay homage to him.”	mn88	22	3	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:22.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn88	22	4	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn88:22.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn88	22	5	mn	88	The Imported Cloth
mn89:1.1	So I have heard.	mn89	1	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.	mn89	1	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some business.	mn89	2	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.2	Then he addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,	mn89	2	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.3	“My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”	mn89	2	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,	mn89	2	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.5	“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.	mn89	2	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:2.6	Please go at your convenience.”	mn89	2	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:3.1	Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Townsville,	mn89	3	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:3.2	heading for the park grounds.	mn89	3	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:3.3	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the park on foot.	mn89	3	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.1	As he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.	mn89	4	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.2	The sight reminded him right away of the Buddha:	mn89	4	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.3	“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	mn89	4	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.4	He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,	mn89	4	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.5	“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn89	4	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:4.6	My good Kārāyana, where is that Buddha at present?”	mn89	4	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.1	“Great king, there is a Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.	mn89	5	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.2	That’s where the Buddha is now staying.”	mn89	5	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.3	“But how far away is that town?”	mn89	5	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.4	“Not far, great king,	mn89	5	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.5	it’s three leagues.	mn89	5	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.6	We can get there while it’s still light.”	mn89	5	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.7	“Well then, harness the chariots, and we shall go to see the Buddha.”	mn89	5	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.8	“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,	mn89	5	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.9	“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.	mn89	5	9	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:5.10	Please go at your convenience.”	mn89	5	10	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:6.1	Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Townsville to Medaḷumpa.	mn89	6	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:6.2	He reached the town while it was still light	mn89	6	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:6.3	and headed for the monastery grounds.	mn89	6	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:6.4	He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.	mn89	6	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:7.1	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	mn89	7	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:7.2	King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,	mn89	7	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:7.3	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?	mn89	7	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:7.4	For I want to see him.”	mn89	7	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:8.1	“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”	mn89	8	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:8.2	The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,	mn89	8	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:8.3	who thought,	mn89	8	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:8.4	“Now the king seeks privacy. I should wait here.”	mn89	8	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:8.5	Then the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door.	mn89	8	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:9.1	King Pasenadi entered the dwelling, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	mn89	9	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:9.2	“Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	mn89	9	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:9.3	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”	mn89	9	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:9.4	“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”	mn89	9	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.1	“Sir, I infer about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	10	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.2	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	10	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.3	It happens, sir, that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period: ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years.	mn89	10	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.4	Some time later—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed—they amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn89	10	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.5	But here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live, to their last breath.	mn89	10	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.6	I don’t see any other spiritual life elsewhere so full and pure.	mn89	10	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.7	That’s why I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	10	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:10.8	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	10	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:11.1	Furthermore, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.	mn89	11	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:11.2	But here I see the mendicants living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.	mn89	11	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:11.3	I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so harmonious.	mn89	11	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:11.4	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	11	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:11.5	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	11	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.1	Furthermore, I have walked and wandered from monastery to monastery and from park to park.	mn89	12	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.2	There I’ve seen some ascetics and brahmins who are thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think.	mn89	12	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.3	It occurred to me:	mn89	12	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.4	‘Clearly these venerables lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, or they’re hiding some bad deed they’ve done.	mn89	12	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.5	That’s why they’re thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think.’	mn89	12	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.6	I went up to them and said:	mn89	12	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.7	‘Venerables, why are you so thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight for people, you’d think?’	mn89	12	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.8	They say:	mn89	12	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.9	‘We have jaundice, great king.’	mn89	12	9	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.10	But here I see mendicants always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.	mn89	12	10	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.11	It occurred to me:	mn89	12	11	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.12	‘Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.	mn89	12	12	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.13	That’s why these venerables are always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.’	mn89	12	13	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.14	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	12	14	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:12.15	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	12	15	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.1	Furthermore, as an anointed aristocratic king	mn89	13	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.2	I am able to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty.	mn89	13	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.3	Yet when I’m sitting in court they interrupt me.	mn89	13	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.4	And I can’t get them	mn89	13	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.5	to stop interrupting me and wait until I’ve finished speaking.	mn89	13	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.7	But here I’ve seen the mendicants	mn89	13	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.8	while the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, and there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.	mn89	13	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.9	Once it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.	mn89	13	9	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.10	Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.	mn89	13	10	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.11	And one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee, to indicate:	mn89	13	11	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.12	‘Hush, venerable, don’t make a sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!’	mn89	13	12	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.13	It occurred to me:	mn89	13	13	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.14	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	mn89	13	14	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.15	how an assembly can be so well trained without rod or sword!’	mn89	13	15	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.16	I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so well trained.	mn89	13	16	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.17	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	13	17	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:13.18	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	13	18	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.1	Furthermore, I’ve seen some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.	mn89	14	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.2	They hear:	mn89	14	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.3	‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’	mn89	14	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.4	They formulate a question, thinking:	mn89	14	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.5	‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question.	mn89	14	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.6	If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that;	mn89	14	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.7	and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’	mn89	14	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.8	When they hear that	mn89	14	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.9	he has come down	mn89	14	9	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.10	they approach him.	mn89	14	10	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.11	The Buddha educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.	mn89	14	11	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.12	They don’t even get around to asking their question to the Buddha, so how could they refute his answer?	mn89	14	12	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.13	Invariably, they become his disciples.	mn89	14	13	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.14	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	14	14	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:14.15	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	14	15	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:15.1	Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins …	mn89	15	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:16.1	some clever householders …	mn89	16	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.1	some clever ascetics who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. …	mn89	17	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.12	They don’t even get around to asking their question to the Buddha, so how could they refute his answer?	mn89	17	12	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.13	Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth.	mn89	17	13	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.14	And he gives them the going-forth.	mn89	17	14	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.15	Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn89	17	15	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.16	They say:	mn89	17	16	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.17	‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!	mn89	17	17	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.18	For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.	mn89	17	18	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.19	But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’	mn89	17	19	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.20	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	17	20	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:17.21	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	17	21	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.1	Furthermore, these chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.	mn89	18	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.2	And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.	mn89	18	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.3	Once it so happened that while I was leading a military campaign and testing Isidatta and Purāṇa I took up residence in a cramped house.	mn89	18	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.4	They spent much of the night discussing the teaching, then they lay down with their heads towards where the Buddha was and their feet towards me.	mn89	18	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.5	It occurred to me:	mn89	18	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.6	‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	mn89	18	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.7	These chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.	mn89	18	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.8	And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.	mn89	18	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.9	Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.’	mn89	18	9	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.10	So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:	mn89	18	10	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:18.11	‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’	mn89	18	11	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:19.1	Furthermore, the Buddha is an aristocrat, and so am I.	mn89	19	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:19.2	The Buddha is Kosalan, and so am I.	mn89	19	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:19.3	The Buddha is eighty years old, and so am I.	mn89	19	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:19.4	Since this is so,	mn89	19	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:19.5	it’s proper for me to show the Buddha such utmost devotion and demonstrate such friendship.	mn89	19	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:20.1	Well, now, sir, I must go.	mn89	20	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:20.2	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn89	20	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:20.3	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	mn89	20	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:20.4	Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn89	20	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.1	Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	mn89	21	1	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.2	“Mendicants, before he got up and left, King Pasenadi spoke shrines to the teaching.	mn89	21	2	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.3	Learn these shrines to the teaching!	mn89	21	3	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.4	Memorize these shrines to the teaching!	mn89	21	4	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.5	Remember these shrines to the teaching!	mn89	21	5	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.6	These shrines to the teaching are beneficial and relate to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	mn89	21	6	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.7	That is what the Buddha said.	mn89	21	7	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn89:21.8	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn89	21	8	mn	89	Shrines to the Teaching
mn90:1.1	So I have heard.	mn90	1	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuññā, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala.	mn90	1	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.1	Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuññā on some business.	mn90	2	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.2	Then he addressed a man,	mn90	2	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.3	“Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn90	2	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.5	And then say:	mn90	2	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.6	‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”	mn90	2	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:2.7	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	mn90	2	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:3.1	The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this.	mn90	3	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:3.3	While the meal was being served, they approached the king and said,	mn90	3	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:3.4	“Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	mn90	3	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:4.1	When he had finished breakfast, King Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn90	4	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:4.2	“Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	mn90	4	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:4.3	“But, great king, couldn’t they get any other messenger?”	mn90	4	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:4.4	So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message.	mn90	4	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:4.9	The Buddha said, “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, great king.”	mn90	4	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:5.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	mn90	5	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:5.2	“I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:	mn90	5	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:5.3	‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’	mn90	5	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:5.4	Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?”	mn90	5	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:5.5	“Great king, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”	mn90	5	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:6.1	Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha,	mn90	6	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:6.2	“General, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”	mn90	6	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:6.3	“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”	mn90	6	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:7.1	Then the king addressed a man,	mn90	7	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:7.2	“Please, worthy man, in my name tell Sañjaya that	mn90	7	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:7.3	King Pasenadi summons him.”	mn90	7	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:7.4	“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.	mn90	7	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	mn90	8	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.2	“Sir, might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing, but that person believed it was something else?	mn90	8	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.3	How then do you recall making this statement?”	mn90	8	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.4	“Great king, I recall making this statement:	mn90	8	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.5	‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will ever know all and see all simultaneously: that is not possible.’”	mn90	8	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:8.6	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	mn90	8	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.1	Sir, there are these four classes:	mn90	9	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.2	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	mn90	9	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.3	Is there any difference between them?”	mn90	9	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.6	“Of the four classes, two are said to be preeminent—	mn90	9	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.7	the aristocrats and the brahmins.	mn90	9	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:9.8	That is, when it comes to bowing down, rising up, greeting with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette.”	mn90	9	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.1	“Sir, I am not asking you about this life,	mn90	10	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.2	but about the life to come.”	mn90	10	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.6	“Great king, there are these five factors that support meditation.	mn90	10	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.7	What five?	mn90	10	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.8	It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:	mn90	10	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.9	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn90	10	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.10	They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.	mn90	10	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.11	They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.	mn90	10	11	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.12	They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	mn90	10	12	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.13	They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	mn90	10	13	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.14	These are the five factors that support meditation.	mn90	10	14	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.15	There are these four classes:	mn90	10	15	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.16	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	mn90	10	16	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.17	If they had these five factors that support meditation,	mn90	10	17	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:10.18	that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn90	10	18	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.1	“Sir, there are these four classes:	mn90	11	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.2	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials.	mn90	11	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.3	If they had these five factors that support meditation,	mn90	11	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.4	would there be any difference between them?”	mn90	11	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.5	“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation.	mn90	11	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.6	Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.	mn90	11	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.7	What do you think, great king?	mn90	11	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.8	Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed, and reach the level of the tamed?”	mn90	11	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.9	“Yes, sir.”	mn90	11	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.10	“But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”	mn90	11	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.11	“No, sir.”	mn90	11	11	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:11.12	“In the same way, there are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.”	mn90	11	12	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.1	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	mn90	12	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.2	Sir, there are these four classes:	mn90	12	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.3	aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and workers.	mn90	12	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.4	If they had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,	mn90	12	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.5	would there be any difference between them?”	mn90	12	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.6	“In that case, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.	mn90	12	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.7	Suppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heat.	mn90	12	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.8	Then another person did the same using sāl wood,	mn90	12	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.9	another used mango wood,	mn90	12	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.10	while another used wood of the cluster fig.	mn90	12	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.11	What do you think, great king?	mn90	12	11	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.12	Would there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood, that is, in the flame, color, or light?”	mn90	12	12	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.13	“No, sir.”	mn90	12	13	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:12.14	“In the same way, when fire has been churned by energy and produced by effort, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.”	mn90	12	14	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:13.1	“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.	mn90	13	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:13.2	But sir, do gods survive?”	mn90	13	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:13.3	“But what exactly are you asking?”	mn90	13	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:13.5	“Whether those gods come back to this place or not.”	mn90	13	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:13.6	“Those gods who are afflicted come back to this place, but those who are unafflicted do not come back.”	mn90	13	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.1	When he said this, General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha,	mn90	14	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.2	“Sir, will the gods who are afflicted topple or expel from their place the gods who are unafflicted?”	mn90	14	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.3	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	mn90	14	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.4	“This General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadi’s son,	mn90	14	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.5	and I am the Buddha’s son.	mn90	14	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.6	Now is the time for one son to confer with another.”	mn90	14	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.7	So Ānanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha,	mn90	14	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.8	“Well then, general, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn90	14	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.9	What do you think, general?	mn90	14	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.10	As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends, where he rules as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”	mn90	14	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.11	“He can, worthy.”	mn90	14	11	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.12	“What do you think, general?	mn90	14	12	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.13	As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend, where he does not rule as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”	mn90	14	13	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.14	“He cannot, worthy.”	mn90	14	14	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.15	“What do you think, general?	mn90	14	15	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.16	Have you heard of the gods of the thirty-three?”	mn90	14	16	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.17	“Yes, worthy,	mn90	14	17	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.18	I’ve heard of them,	mn90	14	18	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.19	and so has the worthy King Pasenadi.”	mn90	14	19	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.20	“What do you think, general?	mn90	14	20	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.21	Can King Pasenadi topple or expel from their place the gods of the thirty-three?”	mn90	14	21	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.22	“King Pasenadi can’t even see the gods of the thirty-three, so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their place?”	mn90	14	22	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:14.23	“In the same way, general, the gods who are afflicted can’t even see the gods who are unafflicted, so how could they possibly topple or expel them from their place?”	mn90	14	23	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.1	Then the king said to the Buddha,	mn90	15	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.2	“Sir, what is this mendicant’s name?”	mn90	15	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.3	“Ānanda, great king.”	mn90	15	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.4	“A joy he is, and a joy he seems!	mn90	15	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.5	What Venerable Ānanda says seems reasonable.	mn90	15	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.6	But sir, does a divinity survive?”	mn90	15	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.7	“But what exactly are you asking?”	mn90	15	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.9	“Whether that Divinity comes back to this place or not.”	mn90	15	9	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:15.10	“A divinity who is afflicted comes back to this place, but one who is unafflicted does not come back.”	mn90	15	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.1	Then a certain man said to the king,	mn90	16	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.2	“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has come.”	mn90	16	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.3	Then King Pasenadi asked Sañjaya,	mn90	16	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.4	“Brahmin, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”	mn90	16	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.5	“It was General Viḍūḍabha, great king.”	mn90	16	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.6	But Viḍūḍabha said,	mn90	16	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:16.7	“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”	mn90	16	7	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.1	Then a certain man said to the king,	mn90	17	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.2	“It’s time to depart, great king.”	mn90	17	2	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.3	So the king said to the Buddha,	mn90	17	3	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.4	“Sir, I asked you about omniscience, and you answered.	mn90	17	4	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.5	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	mn90	17	5	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.6	I asked you about purification in the four classes,	mn90	17	6	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.8	about the gods,	mn90	17	8	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.10	and about divinities, and you answered in each case.	mn90	17	10	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.12	Whatever I asked the Buddha about, he answered.	mn90	17	12	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.13	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	mn90	17	13	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.14	Well, now, sir, I must go.	mn90	17	14	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.15	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn90	17	15	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:17.16	“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”	mn90	17	16	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn90:18.1	Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn90	18	1	mn	90	At Kaṇṇakatthala
mn91:1.1	So I have heard.	mn91	1	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	mn91	1	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā. He was old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he was a hundred and twenty years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	mn91	2	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.1	He heard:	mn91	3	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is wandering in the land of the Videhans, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.	mn91	3	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.3	He has this good reputation:	mn91	3	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn91	3	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn91	3	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn91	3	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:3.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn91	3	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:4.1	Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a pupil named Uttara. He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum.	mn91	4	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:4.2	Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddha’s presence in the land of the Videhans, and added:	mn91	4	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:4.7	“Please, dear Uttara, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.	mn91	4	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:4.9	Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”	mn91	4	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.1	“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”	mn91	5	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.3	“Dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	mn91	5	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	mn91	5	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.5	He has the following seven treasures:	mn91	5	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	mn91	5	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	mn91	5	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	mn91	5	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	mn91	5	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.10	But, dear Uttara, I am the one who gives the hymns,	mn91	5	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:5.11	and you are the one who receives them.”	mn91	5	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.1	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering.	mn91	6	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.2	Traveling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn91	6	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	mn91	6	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.4	and scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	mn91	6	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.5	He saw all of them except for two,	mn91	6	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.6	which he had doubts about:	mn91	6	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.7	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	mn91	6	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.8	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn91	6	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.9	“This student Uttara sees all the marks except for two,	mn91	6	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.10	which he has doubts about:	mn91	6	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:6.11	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	mn91	6	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:7.1	So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	mn91	7	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:7.2	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	mn91	7	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.1	Then Uttara thought,	mn91	8	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.	mn91	8	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.3	Why don’t I follow him and observe his deportment?”	mn91	8	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.4	So Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven months.	mn91	8	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.5	When seven months had passed he set out wandering towards Mithilā.	mn91	8	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.6	There he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu, bowed, and sat down to one side. Brahmāyu said to him,	mn91	8	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.7	“Well, dear Uttara, does the worthy Gotama live up to his reputation or not?”	mn91	8	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.9	“He does, sir.	mn91	8	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:8.11	The worthy Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.	mn91	8	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.1	He has well-planted feet.	mn91	9	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.3	On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.	mn91	9	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.4	He has stretched heels.	mn91	9	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.5	He has long fingers.	mn91	9	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.6	His hands and feet are tender.	mn91	9	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.7	He has serried hands and feet.	mn91	9	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.8	The tops of his feet are arched.	mn91	9	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.9	His calves are like those of an antelope.	mn91	9	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.10	When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.	mn91	9	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.11	His private parts are covered in a foreskin.	mn91	9	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.12	He is golden colored; his skin shines like lustrous gold.	mn91	9	12	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.13	He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	mn91	9	13	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.14	His hairs grow one per pore.	mn91	9	14	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.15	His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise.	mn91	9	15	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.16	His body is tall and straight-limbed.	mn91	9	16	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.17	He has bulging muscles in seven places.	mn91	9	17	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.18	His chest is like that of a lion.	mn91	9	18	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.19	He is filled out between the shoulders.	mn91	9	19	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.20	He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.	mn91	9	20	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.21	His torso is cylindrical.	mn91	9	21	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.22	He has ridged taste buds.	mn91	9	22	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.23	His jaw is like that of a lion.	mn91	9	23	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.24	He has forty teeth.	mn91	9	24	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.25	His teeth are even.	mn91	9	25	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.26	His teeth have no gaps.	mn91	9	26	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.27	His teeth are perfectly white.	mn91	9	27	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.28	He has a large tongue.	mn91	9	28	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.29	He has the voice of the Divinity, like a cuckoo’s call.	mn91	9	29	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.30	His eyes are indigo.	mn91	9	30	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.31	He has eyelashes like a cow’s.	mn91	9	31	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.32	Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.	mn91	9	32	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.33	The crown of his head is like a turban.	mn91	9	33	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:9.34	These are the thirty-two marks of a great man possessed by the worthy Gotama.	mn91	9	34	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.1	When he’s walking he takes the first step with the right foot.	mn91	10	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.2	He doesn’t lift his foot too far or place it too near.	mn91	10	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.3	He doesn’t walk too slow or too fast.	mn91	10	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.4	He walks without knocking his knees or ankles together.	mn91	10	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.5	When he’s walking he keeps his thighs neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	mn91	10	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.6	When he walks, only the lower half of his body moves, and he walks effortlessly.	mn91	10	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.7	When he turns to look he does so with the whole body.	mn91	10	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.8	He doesn’t look directly up or down.	mn91	10	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:10.9	He doesn’t look all around while walking, but focuses a plough’s length in front. Beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and vision.	mn91	10	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:11.1	When entering an inhabited area he keeps his body neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	mn91	11	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.1	He turns around neither too far nor too close to the seat. He doesn’t lean on his hand when sitting down. And he doesn’t just plonk his body down on the seat.	mn91	12	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.2	When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t fidget with his hands or feet.	mn91	12	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.3	He doesn’t sit with his knees or ankles crossed.	mn91	12	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.4	He doesn’t sit with his hand holding his chin.	mn91	12	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.5	When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t shake, tremble, quake, or get nervous, and so he is not nervous at all.	mn91	12	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:12.6	When sitting in inhabited areas he still practices seclusion.	mn91	12	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:13.1	When receiving water for rinsing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	mn91	13	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.1	He receives neither too little nor too much water.	mn91	14	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.2	He rinses the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to rinse his hands; his hands and bowl are rinsed at the same time.	mn91	14	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.3	He doesn’t throw the bowl rinsing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.	mn91	14	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.4	When receiving rice, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too close nor too loose.	mn91	14	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.5	He receives neither too little nor too much rice.	mn91	14	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.6	He eats sauce in a moderate proportion, and doesn’t put too much sauce on his portions.	mn91	14	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.7	He chews over each portion two or three times before swallowing.	mn91	14	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.8	But no grain of rice enters his body unchewed, and none remain in his mouth.	mn91	14	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.9	Only then does he raise another portion to his lips.	mn91	14	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.10	He eats experiencing the taste, but without experiencing greed for the taste.	mn91	14	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.11	He eats food thinking of eight reasons:	mn91	14	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:14.12	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	mn91	14	12	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:15.1	After eating, when receiving water for washing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.	mn91	15	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:15.2	He receives neither too little nor too much water.	mn91	15	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:15.3	He washes the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to wash his hands; his hands and bowl are washed at the same time.	mn91	15	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:15.4	He doesn’t throw the bowl washing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.	mn91	15	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:16.1	After eating he doesn’t put the bowl on the ground too far away or too close. He’s not careless with his bowl, nor does he spend too much time on it.	mn91	16	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:17.1	After eating he sits a while in silence, but doesn’t wait too long to give the verses of appreciation.	mn91	17	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:17.2	After eating he expresses appreciation without criticizing the meal or expecting another one.	mn91	17	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:17.3	Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.	mn91	17	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:17.4	Then he gets up from his seat and leaves.	mn91	17	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:18.1	He walks neither too fast nor too slow, without wanting to get out of there.	mn91	18	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:19.1	He wears his robe on his body neither too high nor too low, neither too clinging nor too loose.	mn91	19	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:19.2	The wind doesn’t blow his robe off his body.	mn91	19	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:19.3	And dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.	mn91	19	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:20.1	When he has gone to the monastery he sits on a seat spread out and washes his feet.	mn91	20	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:20.2	But he doesn’t waste time with pedicures.	mn91	20	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:20.3	When he has washed his feet, he sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in his presence.	mn91	20	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:20.4	He has no intention to hurt himself, hurt others, or hurt both.	mn91	20	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:20.5	He only wishes for the welfare of himself, of others, of both, and of the whole world.	mn91	20	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.1	In the monastery when he teaches Dhamma to an assembly, he neither flatters them nor rebukes them.	mn91	21	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.2	Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.	mn91	21	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.3	The sound of his voice has eight qualities:	mn91	21	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.4	it is clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant.	mn91	21	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.5	He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly.	mn91	21	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:21.6	And when they’ve been inspired with a Dhamma talk by the worthy Gotama they get up from their seats and leave looking back at him alone, and not forgetting their lesson.	mn91	21	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:22.1	I have seen the worthy Gotama walking and standing; entering inhabited areas, and sitting and eating there; sitting silently after eating, and expressing appreciation; going to the monastery, sitting silently there, and teaching Dhamma to an assembly there.	mn91	22	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:22.2	Such is the worthy Gotama; such he is and more than that.”	mn91	22	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:23.1	When he had spoken, the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and uttered this aphorism three times:	mn91	23	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:23.2	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn91	23	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:23.3	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn91	23	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:23.4	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn91	23	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:23.5	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”	mn91	23	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.1	And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Videhan lands, arrived at Mithilā,	mn91	24	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.2	where he stayed in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	mn91	24	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.3	The brahmins and householders of Mithilā heard:	mn91	24	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Mithilā, where he is staying in the Maghadeva Mango Grove.	mn91	24	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.5	He has this good reputation:	mn91	24	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn91	24	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn91	24	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.8	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn91	24	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:24.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn91	24	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:25.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Mithilā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.	mn91	25	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.1	The brahmin Brahmāyu also heard that the Buddha had arrived.	mn91	26	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.2	So he went to the Maghadeva Mango Grove together with several disciples.	mn91	26	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.3	Not far from the grove he thought,	mn91	26	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.4	“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama without first letting him know.”	mn91	26	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.5	So he addressed one of his young students:	mn91	26	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.6	“Here, young student, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	mn91	26	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.8	And then say:	mn91	26	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.9	‘Worthy Gotama, , the brahmin Brahmāyu is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he is a hundred and twenty years old. He has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	mn91	26	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.10	Of all the brahmins and householders residing in Mithilā, Brahmāyu is said to be the foremost in	mn91	26	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.11	wealth,	mn91	26	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.13	hymns,	mn91	26	13	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.15	lifespan, and fame.	mn91	26	15	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.16	He wants to see the worthy Gotama.’”	mn91	26	16	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.17	“Yes, worthy sir,” that young student replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha said,	mn91	26	17	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:26.29	“Please, student, let Brahmāyu come when he’s ready.”	mn91	26	29	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:27.1	The young student went back to Brahmāyu and said to him,	mn91	27	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:27.2	“Your request for an audience with the ascetic Gotama has been granted.	mn91	27	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:27.3	Please go at your convenience.”	mn91	27	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.1	Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha.	mn91	28	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.2	The assembly saw him coming off in the distance,	mn91	28	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.3	and made way for him, as he was well-known and famous.	mn91	28	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.4	Brahmāyu said to that retinue,	mn91	28	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.5	“Enough, gentlemen.	mn91	28	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.6	Please sit on your own seats.	mn91	28	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:28.7	I shall sit here by the ascetic Gotama.”	mn91	28	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.1	Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn91	29	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	mn91	29	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	mn91	29	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.4	He saw all of them except for two,	mn91	29	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.5	which he had doubts about:	mn91	29	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	mn91	29	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.7	Then Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:	mn91	29	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.8	“I have learned of the thirty-two	mn91	29	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.9	marks of a great man.	mn91	29	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.10	There are two that I don’t see	mn91	29	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.11	on the body of the worthy Gotama.	mn91	29	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.12	Are the private parts covered in a foreskin,	mn91	29	12	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.13	O supreme person?	mn91	29	13	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.14	Though called by a word of the feminine gender,	mn91	29	14	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.15	perhaps your tongue is a manly one?	mn91	29	15	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.16	Perhaps your tongue is large,	mn91	29	16	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.17	as we have been informed.	mn91	29	17	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.18	Please stick it out in its full extent,	mn91	29	18	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.19	and so, O seer, dispel my doubt.	mn91	29	19	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.20	For my welfare and benefit in this life,	mn91	29	20	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.21	and happiness in the next.	mn91	29	21	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.22	And I ask you to grant the opportunity	mn91	29	22	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:29.23	to ask whatever I desire.”	mn91	29	23	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.1	Then the Buddha thought,	mn91	30	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.2	“Brahmāyu sees all the marks except for two,	mn91	30	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.3	which he has doubts about:	mn91	30	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	mn91	30	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.5	So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Divinityyu would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	mn91	30	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	mn91	30	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:30.7	Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:	mn91	30	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.1	“The thirty-two marks of a great man	mn91	31	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.2	that you have learned	mn91	31	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.3	are all found on my body:	mn91	31	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.4	so do not doubt, brahmin.	mn91	31	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.5	I have known what should be known,	mn91	31	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.6	and developed what should be developed,	mn91	31	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.7	and given up what should be given up:	mn91	31	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.8	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	mn91	31	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.9	For your welfare and benefit in this life,	mn91	31	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.10	and happiness in the next:	mn91	31	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.11	I grant you the opportunity	mn91	31	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:31.12	to ask whatever you desire.”	mn91	31	12	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.1	Then Brahmāyu thought:	mn91	32	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.2	“My request has been granted.	mn91	32	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.3	Should I ask him about	mn91	32	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.4	what is beneficial in this life or the next?”	mn91	32	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.5	Then he thought,	mn91	32	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.6	“I’m well versed in the benefits that apply to this life,	mn91	32	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.7	and others ask me about this.	mn91	32	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.8	Why don’t I ask the ascetic Gotama about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?”	mn91	32	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.9	So Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:	mn91	32	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.10	“How do you become a brahmin?	mn91	32	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.11	And how do you become a knowledge master?	mn91	32	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.12	How a master of the three knowledges?	mn91	32	12	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.13	And how is one called a scholar?	mn91	32	13	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.14	How do you become a perfected one?	mn91	32	14	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.15	And how a consummate one?	mn91	32	15	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.16	How do you become a sage?	mn91	32	16	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:32.17	And how is one declared to be awakened?”	mn91	32	17	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.1	Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:	mn91	33	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.2	“One who knows their past lives,	mn91	33	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.3	sees heaven and places of loss,	mn91	33	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.4	and has attained the end of rebirth:	mn91	33	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.5	such a sage has perfect insight.	mn91	33	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.6	They know their mind is pure,	mn91	33	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.7	completely freed from greed;	mn91	33	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.8	they’ve given up birth and death,	mn91	33	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.9	and have completed the spiritual journey.	mn91	33	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.10	Gone beyond all things,	mn91	33	10	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:33.11	such a one is declared to be awakened.”	mn91	33	11	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:34.1	When he said this, Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:	mn91	34	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:34.2	“I am the brahmin Brahmāyu, worthy Gotama!	mn91	34	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:34.3	I am the brahmin Brahmāyu!”	mn91	34	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.1	Then that assembly, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,	mn91	35	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing,	mn91	35	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.3	that Divinityyu, who is so well-known and famous, should show the Buddha such utmost devotion.”	mn91	35	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.4	Then the Buddha said to Brahmāyu,	mn91	35	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.5	“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and sit in your own seat, since your mind has such confidence in me.”	mn91	35	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:35.6	So Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seat.	mn91	35	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.1	Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with	mn91	36	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.2	a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven.	mn91	36	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.3	He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	mn91	36	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.4	And when the Buddha knew that Divinityyu’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:	mn91	36	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.5	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	mn91	36	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.6	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	mn91	36	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.7	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Brahmāyu:	mn91	36	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.8	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	mn91	36	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:36.9	Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:	mn91	36	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.1	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn91	37	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn91	37	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn91	37	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	mn91	37	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.5	Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?”	mn91	37	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.6	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn91	37	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:37.7	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn91	37	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:38.1	And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	mn91	38	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:38.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	mn91	38	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:38.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn91	38	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:38.4	For seven days, Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn91	38	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.1	When the seven days had passed, the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan lands.	mn91	39	1	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.2	Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away.	mn91	39	2	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.3	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn91	39	3	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.4	“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away.	mn91	39	4	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.5	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	mn91	39	5	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.6	“Mendicants, the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	mn91	39	6	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.7	With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”	mn91	39	7	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.8	That is what the Buddha said.	mn91	39	8	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn91:39.9	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn91	39	9	mn	91	With Brahmāyu
mn92:1.1	So I have heard.	mn92	1	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans when he arrived at a town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	mn92	1	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.1	The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:	mn92	2	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	mn92	2	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn92	2	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn92	2	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn92	2	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn92	2	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn92	2	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.1	So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn92	3	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	mn92	3	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	mn92	3	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.4	Then he said to the Buddha,	mn92	3	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.5	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	mn92	3	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to him,	mn92	3	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.7	“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”	mn92	3	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.8	For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	mn92	3	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.9	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	mn92	3	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.10	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	mn92	3	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.11	And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.	mn92	3	11	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.13	For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	mn92	3	13	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.14	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	mn92	3	14	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.15	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	mn92	3	15	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:3.16	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn92	3	16	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin,	mn92	4	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.2	“My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin: please listen!	mn92	4	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.3	The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal.	mn92	4	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.4	Please help me out with the manual preparations.”	mn92	4	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.	mn92	4	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:4.6	Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.	mn92	4	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred young students to recite the hymns.	mn92	5	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:6.1	And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.	mn92	6	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:6.2	Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred young students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.	mn92	6	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:6.3	He saw the preparations going on,	mn92	6	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:7.1	and said to Keṇiya,	mn92	7	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:7.2	“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”	mn92	7	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.1	“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.	mn92	8	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.2	Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.	mn92	8	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.3	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	mn92	8	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.4	He has this good reputation:	mn92	8	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn92	8	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:8.6	He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	mn92	8	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:9.1	“Worthy Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	mn92	9	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:9.2	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	mn92	9	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:9.3	“Did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	mn92	9	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:9.4	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	mn92	9	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.1	Then Sela thought,	mn92	10	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.2	“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.	mn92	10	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.3	The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	mn92	10	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	mn92	10	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.5	He has the following seven treasures:	mn92	10	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	mn92	10	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	mn92	10	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	mn92	10	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:10.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.”	mn92	10	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:11.1	“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	mn92	11	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:11.2	When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,	mn92	11	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:11.3	“There, worthy Sela, at that line of blue forest.”	mn92	11	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.1	Then Sela, together with his young students, approached the Buddha.	mn92	12	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.2	He said to his young students,	mn92	12	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.3	“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.	mn92	12	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.4	For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.	mn92	12	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.5	When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.	mn92	12	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:12.6	Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”	mn92	12	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.1	Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn92	13	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	mn92	13	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	mn92	13	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.4	He saw all of them except for two,	mn92	13	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.5	which he had doubts about:	mn92	13	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.6	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	mn92	13	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.7	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn92	13	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.8	“Sela sees all the marks except for two,	mn92	13	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.9	which he has doubts about:	mn92	13	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:13.10	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	mn92	13	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:14.1	The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	mn92	14	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:14.2	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	mn92	14	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.1	Then Sela thought,	mn92	15	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.	mn92	15	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.3	But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one.	mn92	15	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.4	I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said,	mn92	15	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.5	‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’	mn92	15	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.6	Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?”	mn92	15	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:15.7	Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	mn92	15	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,	mn92	16	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;	mn92	16	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.3	golden colored,	mn92	16	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.	mn92	16	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.5	The characteristics	mn92	16	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.6	of a handsome man,	mn92	16	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.7	the marks of a great man,	mn92	16	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.8	are all found on your body.	mn92	16	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.9	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,	mn92	16	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.10	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.	mn92	16	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.11	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,	mn92	16	11	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.12	you shine like the sun.	mn92	16	12	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.13	You’re a mendicant fine to see,	mn92	16	13	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.14	with skin that shines like lustrous gold.	mn92	16	14	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.15	But with such excellent appearance,	mn92	16	15	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.16	what do you want with the ascetic life?	mn92	16	16	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.17	You’re fit to be a king,	mn92	16	17	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.18	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,	mn92	16	18	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.19	victorious in the four quarters,	mn92	16	19	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.20	lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.	mn92	16	20	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.21	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings	mn92	16	21	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.22	ought follow your rule.	mn92	16	22	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.23	Gotama, may you reign	mn92	16	23	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:16.24	as king of kings, lord of mankind!”	mn92	16	24	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:17.1	“I am a king, Sela,	mn92	17	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:17.2	the supreme king of the teaching.	mn92	17	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:17.3	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel	mn92	17	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:17.4	which cannot be rolled back.”	mn92	17	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.1	“You claim to be awakened,	mn92	18	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.2	the supreme king of the teaching.	mn92	18	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.3	‘I roll forth the teaching’:	mn92	18	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.4	so you say, Gotama.	mn92	18	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.5	Then who is your general,	mn92	18	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.6	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?	mn92	18	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.7	Who keeps rolling the wheel	mn92	18	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:18.8	of teaching you rolled forth?”	mn92	18	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”	mn92	19	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.2	said the Buddha,	mn92	19	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.3	“the supreme wheel of teaching.	mn92	19	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,	mn92	19	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.5	keeps it rolling on.	mn92	19	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.6	I have known what should be known,	mn92	19	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.7	and developed what should be developed,	mn92	19	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.8	and given up what should be given up:	mn92	19	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.9	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	mn92	19	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.10	Dispel your doubt in me—	mn92	19	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.11	make up your mind, brahmin!	mn92	19	11	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.12	The sight of a Buddha	mn92	19	12	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.13	is hard to find again.	mn92	19	13	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.14	I am a Buddha, brahmin,	mn92	19	14	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.15	the supreme surgeon,	mn92	19	15	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.16	one of those whose appearance in the world	mn92	19	16	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.17	is hard to find again.	mn92	19	17	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.18	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	mn92	19	18	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.19	crusher of Māra’s army;	mn92	19	19	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.20	having subdued all my opponents,	mn92	19	20	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:19.21	I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”	mn92	19	21	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.1	“Pay heed, sirs, to what	mn92	20	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.2	is spoken by the Clear-eyed One.	mn92	20	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.3	The surgeon, the great hero,	mn92	20	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.	mn92	20	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.5	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	mn92	20	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.6	crusher of Māra’s army;	mn92	20	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.7	who would not be inspired by him,	mn92	20	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.8	even one born in a dark class?	mn92	20	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.9	Those who wish may follow me;	mn92	20	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.10	those who don’t may go.	mn92	20	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.11	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,	mn92	20	11	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:20.12	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	mn92	20	12	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:21.1	“Sir, if you endorse	mn92	21	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:21.2	the teaching of the Buddha,	mn92	21	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:21.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,	mn92	21	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:21.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	mn92	21	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:22.1	“These three hundred brahmins	mn92	22	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:22.2	with joined palms held up, ask:	mn92	22	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:22.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life	mn92	22	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:22.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’”	mn92	22	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:23.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”	mn92	23	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:23.2	said the Buddha,	mn92	23	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:23.3	“apparent in the present life, immediately effective.	mn92	23	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:23.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain	mn92	23	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:23.5	for one who trains with diligence.”	mn92	23	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:24.1	And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	mn92	24	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.1	And when the night had passed Keṇiya had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own hermitage. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	mn92	25	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	mn92	25	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn92	25	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.4	Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn92	25	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.5	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn92	25	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:25.6	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	mn92	25	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.1	“The foremost of sacrifices <j>is the offering to the sacred flame;	mn92	26	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.2	the Sāvitrī Mantra <j>is the foremost of poetic meters;	mn92	26	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.3	of humans, the king is the foremost;	mn92	26	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.4	the ocean’s the foremost of rivers;	mn92	26	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.5	the foremost of stars is the moon;	mn92	26	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.6	the sun is the foremost of lights;	mn92	26	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.7	for those who sacrifice seeking merit,	mn92	26	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.8	the Saṅgha is the foremost.”	mn92	26	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:26.9	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	mn92	26	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:27.1	Then Venerable Sela and his assembly, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn92	27	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:27.2	They understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn92	27	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:27.3	And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected.	mn92	27	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.1	Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	mn92	28	1	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.2	“This is the eighth day since	mn92	28	2	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.3	we went for refuge, O Clear-eyed One.	mn92	28	3	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.4	In these seven days, Blessed One,	mn92	28	4	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.5	we’ve become tamed in your teaching.	mn92	28	5	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.6	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,	mn92	28	6	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.7	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;	mn92	28	7	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.8	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,	mn92	28	8	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.9	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.	mn92	28	9	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.10	You have transcended attachments,	mn92	28	10	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.11	your defilements are shattered;	mn92	28	11	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.12	by not grasping, like a lion,	mn92	28	12	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.13	you’ve given up fear and dread.	mn92	28	13	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.14	These three hundred mendicants	mn92	28	14	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.15	stand with joined palms raised.	mn92	28	15	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.16	Stretch out your feet, great hero:	mn92	28	16	mn	92	With Sela
mn92:28.17	let these giants bow to the Teacher.”	mn92	28	17	mn	92	With Sela
mn93:1.1	So I have heard.	mn93	1	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn93	1	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:2.1	Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.	mn93	2	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:2.2	Then those brahmins thought,	mn93	2	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:2.3	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	mn93	2	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:2.4	Who is capable of debating with him about this?”	mn93	2	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:3.1	Now at that time the student Assalāyana was residing in Sāvatthī. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	mn93	3	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:3.2	Then those brahmins thought,	mn93	3	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:3.4	“This Assalāyana is capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	mn93	3	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.1	So they approached Assalāyana and said to him,	mn93	4	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.2	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	mn93	4	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.3	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	mn93	4	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.4	When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,	mn93	4	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.5	“They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.	mn93	4	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.6	But speakers of principle are hard to debate.	mn93	4	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.7	I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.”	mn93	4	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.8	For a second time, those brahmins said to him	mn93	4	8	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.9	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	mn93	4	9	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.10	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.	mn93	4	10	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.11	For you have lived as a wanderer.”	mn93	4	11	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.12	And for a second time, Assalāyana refused.	mn93	4	12	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.16	For a third time, those brahmins said to him,	mn93	4	16	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.17	“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.	mn93	4	17	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.18	Please, worthy Assalāyana, debate with the ascetic Gotama about this.	mn93	4	18	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.19	For you have lived as a wanderer.	mn93	4	19	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.20	Don’t admit defeat before going into battle!”	mn93	4	20	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.21	When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,	mn93	4	21	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.22	“Clearly, good fellows, I’m not getting through to you when I say:	mn93	4	22	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.23	‘They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.	mn93	4	23	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.24	But speakers of principle are hard to debate.	mn93	4	24	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.25	I’m not capable of debating with the ascetic Gotama about this.’	mn93	4	25	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:4.26	Nevertheless, I shall go at your bidding.”	mn93	4	26	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.1	Then Assalāyana together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn93	5	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn93	5	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.3	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:	mn93	5	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.4	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	mn93	5	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.5	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	mn93	5	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.6	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	mn93	5	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.7	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	mn93	5	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.8	What do you say about this?”	mn93	5	8	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.9	“But Assalāyana, brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding.	mn93	5	9	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.10	Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:	mn93	5	10	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.11	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	mn93	5	11	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.12	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	mn93	5	12	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.13	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	mn93	5	13	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:5.14	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’”	mn93	5	14	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:6.1	“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”	mn93	6	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:6.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	mn93	6	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:6.5	Have you heard that in Greece and Persia and other foreign lands there are only two classes, masters and bonded servants; and that masters may become servants, and servants masters?”	mn93	6	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:6.6	“Yes, I have heard that.”	mn93	6	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:6.7	“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ certainty and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”	mn93	6	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.1	“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”	mn93	7	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	mn93	7	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.5	Suppose an aristocrat were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Would this happen only to an aristocrat, and not to a brahmin?	mn93	7	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.6	Or suppose a peasant,	mn93	7	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.7	or a menial were to act in the same way. Would that result befall only a peasant or a menial, and not to a brahmin?”	mn93	7	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.8	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn93	7	8	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.9	If they acted the same way, the same result would befall an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.	mn93	7	9	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.13	For if any of the four classes were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view, then, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”	mn93	7	13	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:7.14	“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ certainty and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”	mn93	7	14	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:8.1	“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”	mn93	8	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:8.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	mn93	8	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:8.5	Suppose a brahmin were to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and from covetousness, malice, and wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Would this happen only to a brahmin, and not to an aristocrat, a peasant, or a menial?”	mn93	8	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:8.6	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn93	8	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:8.7	If they acted the same way, the same result would befall an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial.	mn93	8	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana

mn93:9.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	mn93	9	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:9.5	Is only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will for this region, and not an aristocrat, peasant, or menial?”	mn93	9	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:9.6	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn93	9	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:9.7	Aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials can all do so.	mn93	9	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana

mn93:10.5	Is only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing cleanser, going to the river, and washing off dust and dirt, and not an aristocrat, peasant, or menial?”	mn93	10	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:10.6	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn93	10	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana

mn93:11.4	“What do you think, Assalāyana?	mn93	11	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:11.5	Suppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people of various births and say to them:	mn93	11	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:11.6	‘Please gentlemen, let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats, brahmins, or chieftains take a drill-stick made of teak, sal, frankincense wood, sandalwood, or cherry wood, light a fire and produce heat.	mn93	11	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:11.7	And let anyone here who was born in a family of corpse-workers, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or scavengers take a drill-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, a pig’s trough, a dustbin, or castor-oil wood, light a fire and produce heat.’	mn93	11	7	mn	93	With Assalāyana

mn93:15.3	Who would the brahmins feed first at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?”	mn93	15	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:15.4	“They’d first feed the young student who was an educated reciter.	mn93	15	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana

mn93:17.2	then you switched to education,	mn93	17	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:17.3	then you switched to abstemious behavior.	mn93	17	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:17.4	Now you’ve come around to believing in purification for the four classes, just as I advocate.”	mn93	17	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:17.5	When he said this, Assalāyana sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	mn93	17	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.1	Knowing this, the Buddha said to him:	mn93	18	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.2	“Once upon a time, Assalāyana, seven brahmin seers settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region. They had the following harmful misconception:	mn93	18	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.3	‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	mn93	18	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.4	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others.	mn93	18	4	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.5	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.’	mn93	18	5	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.6	The seer Devala the Dark heard about this.	mn93	18	6	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.10	So he did up his hair and beard, dressed in magenta robes, put on his boots, grasped a golden staff, and appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers.	mn93	18	10	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.11	Then he wandered about the yard saying,	mn93	18	11	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.12	‘Where, oh where have those brahmin seers gone?	mn93	18	12	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.13	Where, oh where have those brahmin seers gone?’	mn93	18	13	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.14	Then those brahmin seers said,	mn93	18	14	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.15	‘Who’s this wandering about our courtyard like a village lout?	mn93	18	15	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.18	Let’s curse him!’	mn93	18	18	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.19	So they cursed Devala the Dark,	mn93	18	19	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.20	‘Be ashes, lowlife!	mn93	18	20	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.21	Be ashes, lowlife!’	mn93	18	21	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.22	But the more the seers cursed him, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely Devala the Dark became.	mn93	18	22	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.23	Then those brahmin seers said,	mn93	18	23	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.24	‘Our fervor is in vain! Our spiritual path is fruitless!	mn93	18	24	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.25	For when we used to curse someone	mn93	18	25	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.26	to become ashes,	mn93	18	26	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.27	ashes they became.	mn93	18	27	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.28	But the more we curse this one, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely he becomes.’	mn93	18	28	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.29	‘Gentlemen, your fervor is not in vain; your spiritual path is not fruitless.	mn93	18	29	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.30	Please let go of your malevolence towards me.’	mn93	18	30	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.31	‘We let go of our malevolence towards you.	mn93	18	31	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.32	But who are you, sir?’	mn93	18	32	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.33	‘Have you heard of	mn93	18	33	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.34	the seer Devala the Dark?’	mn93	18	34	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.35	‘Yes, sir.’	mn93	18	35	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.36	‘I am he, sirs.’	mn93	18	36	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.37	Then they approached Devala and bowed to him.	mn93	18	37	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.38	Devala said to them,	mn93	18	38	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.39	‘I heard that when the seven brahmin seers had settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region, they had the following harmful misconception:	mn93	18	39	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.40	“Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.	mn93	18	40	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.41	Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.	mn93	18	41	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.42	Only brahmins are purified, not others.	mn93	18	42	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.43	Only brahmins are true-born sons of divinity, born from his mouth, born of divinity, created by divinity, heirs of divinity.”’	mn93	18	43	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.44	‘That’s right, sir.’	mn93	18	44	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.45	‘But do you know	mn93	18	45	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.46	whether your birth mother only had relations with a brahmin and not with a non-brahmin?’	mn93	18	46	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.47	‘We don’t know that.’	mn93	18	47	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.48	‘But do you know	mn93	18	48	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.49	whether your birth mother’s mothers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with non-brahmins?’	mn93	18	49	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.50	‘We don’t know that.’	mn93	18	50	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.51	‘But do you know	mn93	18	51	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.52	whether your birth father only had relations with a brahmin woman and not with a non-brahmin?’	mn93	18	52	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.53	‘We don’t know that.’	mn93	18	53	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.54	‘But do you know	mn93	18	54	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.55	whether your birth father’s fathers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with non-brahmins?’	mn93	18	55	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.56	‘We don’t know that.’	mn93	18	56	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.57	‘But do you know	mn93	18	57	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.58	how an embryo is conceived?’	mn93	18	58	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.59	‘We do know that, sir.	mn93	18	59	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.61	An embryo is conceived when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is ready.’	mn93	18	61	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.62	‘But do you know	mn93	18	62	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.63	for sure whether that virile spirit is an aristocrat, a brahmin, a peasant, or a menial?’	mn93	18	63	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.64	‘We don’t know that.’	mn93	18	64	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.66	‘In that case, sirs, don’t you know	mn93	18	66	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.67	what you are?’	mn93	18	67	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.68	‘In that case, sir, we don’t know	mn93	18	68	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.69	what we are.’	mn93	18	69	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.70	Given that even those seven brahmin seers could not prevail when pursued, pressed, and grilled by the seer Devala on their own genealogy,	mn93	18	70	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:18.71	how could you prevail now being grilled by me on your own genealogy when you and your tradition do not so much as pick up the last spoonful?”	mn93	18	71	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:19.1	When he had spoken, Assalāyana said to him,	mn93	19	1	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:19.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	mn93	19	2	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn93:19.3	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn93	19	3	mn	93	With Assalāyana
mn94:1.1	So I have heard.	mn94	1	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:1.2	At one time Venerable Udena was staying near Varanasi in the Khemiya Mango Grove.	mn94	1	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Ghoṭamukha had arrived at Varanasi on some business.	mn94	2	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.2	Then as he was going for a walk he went to the Khemiya Mango Grove.	mn94	2	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.3	At that time Venerable Udena was walking mindfully in the open air.	mn94	2	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.4	Ghoṭamukha approached and exchanged greetings with him.	mn94	2	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.5	Walking alongside Udena, he said,	mn94	2	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.6	“Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;	mn94	2	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.7	that’s what I think.	mn94	2	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:2.8	Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”	mn94	2	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.1	When he said this, Udena stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, and sat down on the seat spread out.	mn94	3	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.2	Ghoṭamukha also stepped down from the walking path and entered the dwelling, where he stood to one side.	mn94	3	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.3	Udena said to him,	mn94	3	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.4	“There are seats, brahmin.	mn94	3	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.5	Please sit if you wish.”	mn94	3	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.6	“I was just waiting for you to sit down.	mn94	3	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:3.7	For how could one such as I presume to sit first without being invited?”	mn94	3	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.1	Then he took a low seat and sat to one side,	mn94	4	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.2	where he said,	mn94	4	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.3	“Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;	mn94	4	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.4	that’s what I think.	mn94	4	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.5	Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”	mn94	4	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.6	“Brahmin, we can discuss this. But only if you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying:	mn94	4	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.7	‘Sir, why is this? What does that mean?’”	mn94	4	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:4.8	“Let us discuss this. I will do as you say.”	mn94	4	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.1	“Brahmin, these four people are found in the world.	mn94	5	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.2	What four?	mn94	5	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.3	One person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	mn94	5	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.4	One person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.	mn94	5	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.5	One person mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	mn94	5	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.6	One person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	mn94	5	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.7	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.	mn94	5	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.8	Which one of these four people do you like the sound of?”	mn94	5	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.9	“Sir, I don’t like the sound of the first three people.	mn94	5	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:5.13	I only like the sound of the last person, who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others.”	mn94	5	13	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.1	“But why don’t you like the sound of those three people?”	mn94	6	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.2	“Sir, the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn94	6	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.3	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn94	6	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.4	The person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn94	6	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.5	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn94	6	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.6	The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn94	6	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.7	That’s why I don’t like the sound of that person.	mn94	6	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.8	The person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain.	mn94	6	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:6.9	That’s why I like the sound of that person.”	mn94	6	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.1	“There are, brahmin, these two groups of people.	mn94	7	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.2	What two?	mn94	7	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.3	There’s one group of people who, being obsessed with jeweled earrings, seeks partners and children, male and female bondservants, fields and lands, and gold and currency.	mn94	7	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.4	And there’s another group of people who, not being obsessed with jeweled earrings, has given up partner and children, male and female bondservants, fields and lands, and gold and currency, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn94	7	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.5	Now, brahmin, that person who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—	mn94	7	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.7	in which of these two groups of people do you usually find such a person?”	mn94	7	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.9	“I usually find such a person in	mn94	7	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:7.10	the group that has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	mn94	7	10	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.1	“Just now I understood you to say:	mn94	8	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.2	‘Worthy ascetic, there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life;	mn94	8	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.3	that’s what I think.	mn94	8	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.4	Yet I have not seen honorable ones such as yourself, or a relevant teaching.”	mn94	8	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.5	“Well, I obviously had my reasons for saying that, master Udena.	mn94	8	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.6	But there is such a thing as a principled renunciate life.	mn94	8	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.7	That’s what I think,	mn94	8	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.8	and that’s how you should remember me.	mn94	8	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:8.9	Now, these four people that you’ve spoken of in a brief summary: please explain them to me in detail, out of sympathy.”	mn94	8	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:9.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn94	9	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:9.2	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Ghoṭamukha.	mn94	9	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:9.3	Udena said this:	mn94	9	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.1	“What person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves?	mn94	10	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.2	It’s when a person goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.	mn94	10	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.3	They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel.	mn94	10	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.4	They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.	mn94	10	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.5	They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.	mn94	10	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.6	They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.	mn94	10	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.7	They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.	mn94	10	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.8	They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.	mn94	10	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.9	They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice.	mn94	10	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.10	They constantly stand, refusing seats.	mn94	10	10	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.11	They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting.	mn94	10	11	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.12	They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed.	mn94	10	12	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.13	They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening.	mn94	10	13	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.14	And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.	mn94	10	14	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:10.15	This is called a person who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.	mn94	10	15	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:11.1	And what person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others?	mn94	11	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:11.2	It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood.	mn94	11	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:11.3	This is called a person who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others.	mn94	11	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.1	And what person mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others?	mn94	12	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.2	It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.	mn94	12	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.3	He has a new ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.	mn94	12	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.4	There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.	mn94	12	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.5	The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder.	mn94	12	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.6	He says:	mn94	12	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.7	‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’	mn94	12	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.8	His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.	mn94	12	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:12.9	This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.	mn94	12	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:13.1	And what person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,	mn94	13	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:13.2	living without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine?	mn94	13	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:14.1	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	mn94	14	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:14.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn94	14	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:14.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn94	14	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	mn94	15	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.2	They gain faith in the Realized One,	mn94	15	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.3	and reflect:	mn94	15	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	mn94	15	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn94	15	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn94	15	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn94	15	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:15.8	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	mn94	15	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:16.1	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	mn94	16	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha

mn94:17.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	mn94	17	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:17.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	mn94	17	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:17.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	mn94	17	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha

mn94:20.1	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	mn94	20	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:20.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn94	20	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:21.1	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	mn94	21	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha

mn94:22.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn94	22	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:23.1	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn94	23	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:24.1	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn94	24	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:25.1	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn94	25	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:26.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn94	26	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:26.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn94	26	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:27.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn94	27	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:27.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn94	27	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:28.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn94	28	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:28.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn94	28	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:28.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn94	28	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:29.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn94	29	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:29.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn94	29	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:29.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn94	29	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:30.1	This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.	mn94	30	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:30.2	They live without wishes in this very life, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine.”	mn94	30	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:31.1	When he had spoken, Ghoṭamukha said to him,	mn94	31	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:31.2	“Excellent, worthy Udena! Excellent!	mn94	31	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:31.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the worthy Udena has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn94	31	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:31.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Udena, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn94	31	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:31.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn94	31	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.1	“Brahmin, don’t go for refuge to me.	mn94	32	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.2	You should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.”	mn94	32	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.3	“But worthy Udena, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	mn94	32	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.4	“Brahmin, the Buddha has already become fully quenched.”	mn94	32	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.5	“Worthy Udena, if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues, or twenty, or even up to a hundred leagues away, I’d go a hundred leagues to see him.	mn94	32	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.11	But since the Buddha has become fully quenched, I go for refuge to that fully quenched Buddha, to the teaching, and to the Saṅgha.	mn94	32	11	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:32.12	From this day forth, may the worthy Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	mn94	32	12	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.1	Worthy Udena, the king of Aṅga gives me a regular daily allowance. I will give you one portion of that.”	mn94	33	1	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.2	“But brahmin, what does the king of Aṅga give you as a regular daily allowance?”	mn94	33	2	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.3	“Five hundred dollars.”	mn94	33	3	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.4	“It’s not proper for us to receive gold and currency.”	mn94	33	4	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.5	“If that’s not proper, I will have a dwelling built for the worthy Udena.”	mn94	33	5	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.6	“If you want to build me a dwelling, then build an assembly hall for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta.”	mn94	33	6	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.7	“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the worthy Udena, since he encourages me to give to the Saṅgha.	mn94	33	7	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.8	So with this allowance and another one I will have an assembly hall built for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta.”	mn94	33	8	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.9	And so he had that hall built.	mn94	33	9	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn94:33.10	And these days it’s called the “Ghoṭamukhī”.	mn94	33	10	mn	94	With Ghoṭamukha
mn95:1.1	So I have heard.	mn95	1	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Opāsāda.	mn95	1	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:1.3	He stayed in the Godswood of sal trees to the north of Opāsāda.	mn95	1	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:2.1	Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	mn95	2	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.1	The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard:	mn95	3	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north.	mn95	3	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.3	He has this good reputation:	mn95	3	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn95	3	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn95	3	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn95	3	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:3.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn95	3	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:4.1	Then, having departed Opāsāda, they formed into companies and headed north to the Godswood.	mn95	4	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap.	mn95	5	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:5.2	He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Godswood,	mn95	5	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:5.3	and addressed his butler,	mn95	5	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:5.4	“My butler, why are the brahmins and householders heading north for the Godswood?”	mn95	5	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.1	“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north.	mn95	6	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.2	He has this good reputation:	mn95	6	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.3	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn95	6	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.4	They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.”	mn95	6	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.5	“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them:	mn95	6	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.6	‘Sirs, the brahmin Caṅkī asks	mn95	6	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.7	you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’”	mn95	6	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:6.8	“Yes, sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked.	mn95	6	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.1	Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Opāsāda on some business.	mn95	7	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.2	They heard that	mn95	7	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.3	the brahmin Caṅkī was going to see the ascetic Gotama.	mn95	7	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.4	They approached Caṅkī and said to him,	mn95	7	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.5	“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?”	mn95	7	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:7.6	“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.”	mn95	7	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.1	“Please don’t!	mn95	8	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.2	It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	mn95	8	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.3	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.	mn95	8	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.4	You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	mn95	8	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.5	For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	mn95	8	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.6	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.	mn95	8	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.7	You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. …	mn95	8	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.8	You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. …	mn95	8	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.9	You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You are magnificent and splendid as the Divinity, remarkable to behold. …	mn95	8	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.10	You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. …	mn95	8	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.11	You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. …	mn95	8	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.12	You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. …	mn95	8	12	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.13	You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosala	mn95	8	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.14	and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. …	mn95	8	14	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.15	You live in Opāsāda, a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.	mn95	8	15	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.16	For all these reasons it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama;	mn95	8	16	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:8.17	it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.”	mn95	8	17	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.1	When they had spoken, Caṅkī said to those brahmins:	mn95	9	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.2	“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama,	mn95	9	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.3	and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me.	mn95	9	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.4	He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.	mn95	9	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.5	For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me;	mn95	9	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.6	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	mn95	9	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.7	When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. …	mn95	9	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.8	He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. …	mn95	9	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.9	Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. …	mn95	9	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī

mn95:9.13	He’s a tutor of tutors. …	mn95	9	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.14	He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. …	mn95	9	14	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.15	He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn’t wish any harm upon the community of brahmins. …	mn95	9	15	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.16	He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. …	mn95	9	16	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.17	He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. …	mn95	9	17	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.18	People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. …	mn95	9	18	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.19	Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. …	mn95	9	19	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.20	He has this good reputation:	mn95	9	20	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.21	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ …	mn95	9	21	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.22	He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. …	mn95	9	22	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.23	King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	mn95	9	23	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.24	King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	mn95	9	24	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.25	The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. …	mn95	9	25	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.26	The ascetic Gotama has arrived to stay in the Godswood to the north of Opāsāda.	mn95	9	26	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.27	Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest,	mn95	9	27	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.28	and should be honored and respected as such.	mn95	9	28	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.31	For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me,	mn95	9	31	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.32	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	mn95	9	32	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.33	This is the extent of the worthy Gotama’s praise that I have memorized. But his praises are not confined to this,	mn95	9	33	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.34	for the praise of the worthy Gotama is limitless.	mn95	9	34	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.35	The possession of even a single one of these factors makes it inappropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me,	mn95	9	35	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.36	rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.	mn95	9	36	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:9.37	Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”	mn95	9	37	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:10.1	Then Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn95	10	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:10.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	mn95	10	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.1	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahmins.	mn95	11	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.2	And the student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	mn95	11	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.3	While the senior brahmins were conversing together with the Buddha, he interrupted.	mn95	11	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.4	Then the Buddha rebuked Kāpaṭika,	mn95	11	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.5	“Venerable Bhāradvāja, don’t interrupt the senior brahmins.	mn95	11	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.6	Wait until they’ve finished speaking.”	mn95	11	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.7	When he had spoken, Caṅkī said to the Buddha,	mn95	11	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.8	“Worthy Gotama, don’t rebuke the student Kāpaṭika.	mn95	11	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:11.9	He’s a gentleman, learned and astute, who enunciates well. He is capable of debating with the worthy Gotama about this.”	mn95	11	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn95	12	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.2	“Clearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three Vedas.	mn95	12	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.3	That’s why the brahmins put him at the front.”	mn95	12	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.4	Then Kāpaṭika thought,	mn95	12	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.5	“When the ascetic Gotama looks at me, I’ll ask him a question.”	mn95	12	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.6	Then the Buddha, knowing Kāpaṭika’s train of thought, looked at him.	mn95	12	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.7	Then Kāpaṭika thought,	mn95	12	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.8	“The ascetic Gotama is engaging with me.	mn95	12	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.9	Why don’t I ask him a question?”	mn95	12	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.10	Then he said,	mn95	12	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.11	“Worthy Gotama, regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins, the brahmins come to the categorical conclusion:	mn95	12	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.12	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	mn95	12	12	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:12.13	What do you say about this?”	mn95	12	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.1	“Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:	mn95	13	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.2	‘I know this, I see this:	mn95	13	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.3	this is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn95	13	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.4	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn95	13	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.5	“Well, is there even a single tutor of the brahmins, or a tutors’ tutor, or anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors, who says this:	mn95	13	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.6	‘I know this, I see this:	mn95	13	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.7	this is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn95	13	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.8	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn95	13	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.9	“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	mn95	13	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.10	Did even they say:	mn95	13	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.11	‘We know this, we see this:	mn95	13	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.12	this is the only truth, anything else is futile’?”	mn95	13	12	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.13	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn95	13	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.14	“So, Bhāradvāja, it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins,	mn95	13	14	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.17	not even anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors,	mn95	13	17	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.20	nor even the ancient seers of the brahmins who say:	mn95	13	20	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.21	‘We know this, we see this:	mn95	13	21	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.22	this is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	mn95	13	22	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.23	Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	mn95	13	23	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.24	In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be like a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	mn95	13	24	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.25	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	mn95	13	25	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:13.26	This being so, doesn’t the brahmins’ faith turn out to be baseless?”	mn95	13	26	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.1	“The brahmins don’t just honor this because of faith, but also because of oral transmission.”	mn95	14	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.2	“First you relied on faith, now you speak of oral transmission.	mn95	14	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.3	These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways.	mn95	14	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.4	What five?	mn95	14	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.5	Faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, and acceptance of a view after deliberation.	mn95	14	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.7	Even though you have full faith in something, it may be vacuous, hollow, and false.	mn95	14	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.8	And even if you don’t have full faith in something, it may be true and real, not otherwise.	mn95	14	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.9	Even though you fully endorse something …	mn95	14	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.10	something may be well transmitted …	mn95	14	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.11	something may be well thought out …	mn95	14	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.12	something may be well deliberated, it may be vacuous, hollow, and false.	mn95	14	12	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.13	And even if something is not well deliberated, it may be true and real, not otherwise.	mn95	14	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.14	For a sensible person who is preserving truth this is not sufficient to come to the categorical conclusion:	mn95	14	14	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:14.15	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’”	mn95	14	15	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.1	“But worthy Gotama, how do you define the preservation of truth?”	mn95	15	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.3	“If a person has faith,	mn95	15	3	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.4	they preserve truth by saying, ‘Such is my faith.’	mn95	15	4	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.5	But they don’t yet come to the categorical conclusion:	mn95	15	5	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.6	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	mn95	15	6	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.7	If a person has a belief …	mn95	15	7	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.8	or has received an oral transmission …	mn95	15	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.9	or has a reasoned reflection about something …	mn95	15	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.10	or has accepted a view after contemplation,	mn95	15	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.11	they preserve truth by saying, ‘Such is the view I have accepted after contemplation.’	mn95	15	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī

mn95:15.14	That’s how the preservation of truth is defined, Bhāradvāja. I describe the preservation of truth as defined in this way.	mn95	15	14	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:15.15	But this is not yet the awakening to the truth.”	mn95	15	15	mn	95	With Caṅkī

mn95:16.2	But worthy Gotama, how do you define awakening to the truth?”	mn95	16	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:17.1	“Bhāradvāja, take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.	mn95	17	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:17.2	A householder or their child approaches and scrutinizes them for three kinds of things:	mn95	17	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī

mn95:34.8	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	mn95	34	8	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:34.9	Whatever I have asked the worthy Gotama about he has answered me.	mn95	34	9	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:34.10	I endorse and accept this, and am satisfied with it.	mn95	34	10	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:34.11	Worthy Gotama, I used to think this:	mn95	34	11	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:34.12	‘Who are these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman next to those who understand the teaching?’	mn95	34	12	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:34.13	The Buddha has inspired me to have love, confidence, and respect for ascetics!	mn95	34	13	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:35.1	Excellent, worthy Gotama! …	mn95	35	1	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn95:35.2	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn95	35	2	mn	95	With Caṅkī
mn96:1.1	So I have heard.	mn96	1	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn96	1	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:2.1	Then Esukārī the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn96	2	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn96	2	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.1	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of service:	mn96	3	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.2	for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial.	mn96	3	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.3	This is the service they prescribe for a brahmin:	mn96	3	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.4	‘A brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial may all serve a brahmin.’	mn96	3	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.6	This is the service they prescribe for an aristocrat:	mn96	3	6	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.7	‘An aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial may all serve an aristocrat.’	mn96	3	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.9	This is the service they prescribe for a peasant:	mn96	3	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.10	‘A peasant or a menial may serve a peasant.’	mn96	3	10	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.12	This is the service they prescribe for a menial:	mn96	3	12	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.13	‘Only a menial may serve a menial.	mn96	3	13	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.14	For who else will serve a menial?’	mn96	3	14	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.16	These are the four kinds of service that the brahmins prescribe.	mn96	3	16	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:3.17	What do you say about this?”	mn96	3	17	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:4.1	“But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of service?”	mn96	4	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:4.2	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn96	4	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:4.3	“It’s as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person, telling them, ‘Eat this meat and pay for it!’	mn96	4	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:4.4	In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of service without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins.	mn96	4	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:5.1	Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.	mn96	5	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:5.2	I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them makes you worse, not better.	mn96	5	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:5.3	And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you better, not worse.	mn96	5	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:6.1	If they were to ask an aristocrat this,	mn96	6	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:6.2	‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’	mn96	6	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:6.3	Answering rightly, an aristocrat would say,	mn96	6	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:6.4	‘Someone in whose service I get better.’	mn96	6	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.1	If they were to ask a brahmin …	mn96	7	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.2	a peasant …	mn96	7	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.3	or a menial this,	mn96	7	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.4	‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’	mn96	7	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.5	Answering rightly, a menial would say,	mn96	7	5	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.6	‘Someone in whose service I get better.’	mn96	7	6	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.7	Brahmin, I don’t say that an eminent family makes you a better or worse person.	mn96	7	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.8	I don’t say that being very beautiful makes you a better or worse person.	mn96	7	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:7.9	I don’t say that being very wealthy makes you a better or worse person.	mn96	7	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.1	For some people from eminent families kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.	mn96	8	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.2	That’s why I don’t say that an eminent family makes you an even truer person.	mn96	8	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.3	But some people from eminent families also refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view.	mn96	8	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.4	That’s why I don’t say that an eminent family makes you a worse person.	mn96	8	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.5	People who are very beautiful,	mn96	8	5	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.6	or not very beautiful,	mn96	8	6	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.7	who are very wealthy,	mn96	8	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.8	or not very wealthy,	mn96	8	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.9	may also behave in the same ways.	mn96	8	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:8.10	That’s why I don’t say that any of these things makes you a better or worse person.	mn96	8	10	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:9.1	Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.	mn96	9	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:9.2	And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.	mn96	9	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:9.3	I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them doesn’t make you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.”	mn96	9	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.1	When he had spoken, Esukārī said to him:	mn96	10	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.2	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of wealth:	mn96	10	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.3	for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a peasant, and a menial.	mn96	10	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.4	The wealth they prescribe for a brahmin is living on alms.	mn96	10	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.5	A brahmin who scorns his own wealth, living on alms, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.	mn96	10	5	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.7	The wealth they prescribe for an aristocrat is the bow and quiver.	mn96	10	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.8	An aristocrat who scorns his own wealth, the bow and quiver, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.	mn96	10	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.10	The wealth they prescribe for a peasant is farming and animal husbandry.	mn96	10	10	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.11	A peasant who scorns his own wealth, farming and animal husbandry, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.	mn96	10	11	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.13	The wealth they prescribe for a menial is the scythe and flail.	mn96	10	13	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.14	A menial who scorns his own wealth, the scythe and flail, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.	mn96	10	14	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.16	These are the four kinds of wealth that the brahmins prescribe.	mn96	10	16	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:10.17	What do you say about this?”	mn96	10	17	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:11.1	“But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of wealth?”	mn96	11	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:11.2	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn96	11	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:11.3	“It’s as if they were to force a chop on a poor, penniless person, telling them, ‘Eat this meat and pay for it!’	mn96	11	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:11.4	In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of wealth without the consent of these ascetics and brahmins.	mn96	11	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.1	I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching.	mn96	12	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.2	But they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnated.	mn96	12	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.3	If they incarnate in a family of aristocrats they are reckoned as an aristocrat.	mn96	12	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.4	If they incarnate in a family of brahmins they are reckoned as a brahmin.	mn96	12	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.5	If they incarnate in a family of peasants they are reckoned as a peasant.	mn96	12	5	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.6	If they incarnate in a family of menials they are reckoned as a menial.	mn96	12	6	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.7	It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it burns.	mn96	12	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.8	A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire.	mn96	12	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.9	A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire.	mn96	12	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.10	A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire.	mn96	12	10	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.11	A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire.	mn96	12	11	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.12	In the same way, I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching.	mn96	12	12	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:12.13	But they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnated.	mn96	12	13	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:13.1	Suppose someone from a family of aristocrats goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One they refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and sex. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view. They succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.	mn96	13	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:13.2	Suppose someone from a family of brahmins …	mn96	13	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:13.3	peasants …	mn96	13	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:13.4	menials goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One … they succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.	mn96	13	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.1	What do you think, brahmin?	mn96	14	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.2	Is only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region, and not an aristocrat, peasant, or menial?”	mn96	14	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.3	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn96	14	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.4	Aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials can all do so.	mn96	14	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.8	For all four classes are capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region.”	mn96	14	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.9	“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,	mn96	14	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:14.10	brahmins,	mn96	14	10	mn	96	With Esukārī

mn96:14.12	or menials goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One … they succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.	mn96	14	12	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.1	What do you think, brahmin?	mn96	15	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.2	Is only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing cleanser, going to the river, and washing off dust and dirt, and not an aristocrat, peasant, or menial?”	mn96	15	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.3	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn96	15	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.8	All four classes are capable of doing this.”	mn96	15	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.9	“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,	mn96	15	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:15.10	brahmins,	mn96	15	10	mn	96	With Esukārī

mn96:16.1	What do you think, brahmin?	mn96	16	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.2	Suppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people born in different classes and say to them:	mn96	16	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.3	‘Please gentlemen, let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats, brahmins, or chieftains take a drill-stick made of teak, sal, frankincense wood, sandalwood, or cherry wood, light a fire and produce heat.	mn96	16	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.4	And let anyone here who was born in a family of corpse-workers, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or scavengers take a drill-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, a pig’s trough, a dustbin, or castor-oil wood, light a fire and produce heat.’	mn96	16	4	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.5	What do you think, brahmin?	mn96	16	5	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.6	Would only the fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,	mn96	16	6	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.7	and not the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood?”	mn96	16	7	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.8	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn96	16	8	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.9	The fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood would have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,	mn96	16	9	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.10	and so would the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood.	mn96	16	10	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.11	For all fire has flames, color, and radiance, and is usable as fire.”	mn96	16	11	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:16.12	“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,	mn96	16	12	mn	96	With Esukārī

mn96:17.1	When he had spoken, Esukārī said to him,	mn96	17	1	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:17.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! …	mn96	17	2	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn96:17.3	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn96	17	3	mn	96	With Esukārī
mn97:1.1	So I have heard.	mn97	1	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn97	1	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn97	2	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.2	Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn97	2	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,	mn97	2	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.4	“Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and strong?”	mn97	2	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.5	“He is, reverend.”	mn97	2	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.6	“And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and strong.”	mn97	2	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.7	“It is.”	mn97	2	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.8	“Reverend, at the rice checkpoint at the city gate there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni.	mn97	2	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.9	I hope that he is healthy and strong?”	mn97	2	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.10	“He too is well.”	mn97	2	10	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.11	“But is he diligent?”	mn97	2	11	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.12	“How could he possibly be diligent?	mn97	2	12	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.13	Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders.	mn97	2	13	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.14	His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away.	mn97	2	14	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.15	And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.”	mn97	2	15	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.16	“Oh, it’s bad news	mn97	2	16	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.17	to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent.	mn97	2	17	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:2.18	Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”	mn97	2	18	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:3.1	When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha.	mn97	3	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:3.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,	mn97	3	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:3.3	where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn97	3	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.1	Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	mn97	4	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.2	Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city.	mn97	4	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.3	Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he approached Dhanañjāni.	mn97	4	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.4	Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance,	mn97	4	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.5	Dhanañjāni went to him and said,	mn97	4	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.6	“Here, worthy Sāriputta, drink some fresh milk before the meal time.”	mn97	4	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.7	“Enough, brahmin,	mn97	4	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.8	I’ve finished eating for today.	mn97	4	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.9	I shall be at the root of that tree for the day’s meditation.	mn97	4	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.10	Come see me there.”	mn97	4	10	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:4.11	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.	mn97	4	11	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:5.1	When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.	mn97	5	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him,	mn97	5	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:5.3	“I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?”	mn97	5	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:5.4	“How can I possibly be diligent, worthy Sāriputta? I have to provide for my mother and father, my wives and children, and my bondservants and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, deities, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.”	mn97	5	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:6.1	“What do you think, Dhanañjāni?	mn97	6	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:6.2	Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.	mn97	6	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:6.3	Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of their parents? Or could their parents save them by pleading that the acts had been done for their sake?”	mn97	6	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:6.4	“No, worthy Sāriputta.	mn97	6	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni

mn97:15.2	Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of fattening and building up their body? Or could anyone else save them by pleading that the acts had been done for that reason?”	mn97	15	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:15.3	“No, worthy Sāriputta.	mn97	15	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:15.4	Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”	mn97	15	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:16.1	“Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their parents, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”	mn97	16	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:16.3	“Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parents.	mn97	16	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni

mn97:25.3	“Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner.	mn97	25	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:25.5	For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct.”	mn97	25	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:25.6	“Dhanañjāni, others have livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate. By means of these it’s possible to fatten and build up your body, avoid bad deeds, and practice the path of goodness.”	mn97	25	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:26.1	Then Dhanañjāni the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what Venerable Sāriputta said, got up from his seat and left.	mn97	26	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.1	Some time later Dhanañjāni became sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn97	27	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.2	Then he addressed a man,	mn97	27	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.3	“Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	mn97	27	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.4	‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn97	27	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.5	He bows with his head to your feet.’	mn97	27	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.6	Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	mn97	27	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.7	‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn97	27	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.8	He bows with his head to your feet.’	mn97	27	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.9	And then say:	mn97	27	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.10	‘Sir, please visit Dhanañjāni at his home out of sympathy.’”	mn97	27	10	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.11	“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Dhanañjāni asked.	mn97	27	11	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:27.18	Sāriputta consented with silence.	mn97	27	18	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:28.1	He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Dhanañjāni’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out and said to Dhanañjāni,	mn97	28	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:28.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, Dhanañjāni; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	mn97	28	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.1	“I’m not keeping well, worthy Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.	mn97	29	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.2	The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.	mn97	29	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.3	I’m not keeping well.	mn97	29	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.4	The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	mn97	29	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.5	I’m not keeping well.	mn97	29	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.6	The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn97	29	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.7	I’m not keeping well.	mn97	29	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.8	The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	mn97	29	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:29.9	I’m not keeping well, worthy Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”	mn97	29	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.1	“Dhanañjāni, which do you think is better:	mn97	30	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.2	hell or the animal realm?”	mn97	30	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.3	“The animal realm is better.”	mn97	30	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.4	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.5	the animal realm or the ghost realm?”	mn97	30	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.6	“The ghost realm is better.”	mn97	30	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.7	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.8	the ghost realm or human life?”	mn97	30	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.9	“Human life is better.”	mn97	30	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.10	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	10	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni

mn97:30.18	“The gods of Yama.”	mn97	30	18	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.19	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	19	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.20	the gods of Yama or the joyful gods?”	mn97	30	20	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.21	“The joyful gods.”	mn97	30	21	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.22	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	22	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.23	the joyful gods or the gods who love to imagine?”	mn97	30	23	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.24	“The gods who love to imagine.”	mn97	30	24	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.25	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	30	25	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.26	the gods who love to imagine or the gods who control what is imagined by others?”	mn97	30	26	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:30.27	“The gods who control what is imagined by others.”	mn97	30	27	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.1	“Which do you think is better:	mn97	31	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.2	the gods who control what is imagined by others or the realm of divinity?”	mn97	31	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.3	“Worthy Sāriputta speaks of the realm of divinity!	mn97	31	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.4	Worthy Sāriputta speaks of the realm of divinity!”	mn97	31	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.5	Then Sāriputta thought:	mn97	31	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.6	“These brahmins are devoted to the realm of divinity.	mn97	31	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.7	Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Divinity?”	mn97	31	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.8	“Dhanañjāni, I shall teach you a path to the company of Divinity.	mn97	31	8	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.9	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn97	31	9	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.10	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.	mn97	31	10	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:31.11	Venerable Sāriputta said this:	mn97	31	11	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:32.1	“And what is a path to company with Divinity?	mn97	32	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:32.2	Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn97	32	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:32.3	This is a path to company with Divinity.	mn97	32	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:33-35.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn97	33-35	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:33-35.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	mn97	33-35	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:33-35.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn97	33-35	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:33-35.4	This is a path to company with Divinity.”	mn97	33-35	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:36.1	“Well then, worthy Sāriputta, in my name bow with your head at the Buddha’s feet. Say to him:	mn97	36	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:36.2	‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn97	36	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:36.3	He bows with his head to your feet.’”	mn97	36	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:36.4	Then Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.	mn97	36	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:36.5	Not long after Sāriputta had departed, Dhanañjāni passed away and was reborn in the realm of divinity.	mn97	36	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:37.1	Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,	mn97	37	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:37.2	“Mendicants, Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.”	mn97	37	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.1	Then Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,	mn97	38	1	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.2	“Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn97	38	2	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.3	He bows with his head to your feet.”	mn97	38	3	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.4	“But Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior realm of divinity, why did you get up from your seat and leave while there was still more left to do?”	mn97	38	4	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.5	“Sir, I thought:	mn97	38	5	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.6	‘These brahmins are devoted to the realm of divinity. Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Divinity?’”	mn97	38	6	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn97:38.7	“And Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhanañjāni has passed away and been reborn in the realm of divinity.”	mn97	38	7	mn	97	With Dhanañjāni
mn98:1.1	So I have heard.	mn98	1	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	mn98	1	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:2.1	Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included	mn98	2	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:2.2	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.	mn98	2	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.1	Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:	mn98	3	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.2	“How do you become a brahmin?”	mn98	3	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.3	Bhāradvāja said this:	mn98	3	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.4	“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation—	mn98	3	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.5	then you’re a brahmin.”	mn98	3	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.6	Vāseṭṭha said this:	mn98	3	6	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.7	“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—	mn98	3	7	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:3.8	then you’re a brahmin.”	mn98	3	8	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:4.1	But neither was able to persuade the other.	mn98	4	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.1	So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,	mn98	5	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.2	“Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	mn98	5	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.3	He has this good reputation:	mn98	5	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn98	5	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.5	Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.	mn98	5	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.6	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	mn98	5	6	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:5.7	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.	mn98	5	7	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:6.1	So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn98	6	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:6.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,	mn98	6	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:6.3	and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:	mn98	6	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.1	“We’re both authorized masters	mn98	7	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.2	of the three Vedas.	mn98	7	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.3	I’m a student of Pokkharasāti,	mn98	7	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.4	and he of Tārukkha.	mn98	7	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.5	We’re fully qualified	mn98	7	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.6	in all the Vedic experts teach.	mn98	7	6	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.7	As philologists and grammarians,	mn98	7	7	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.8	we match our tutors in recitation.	mn98	7	8	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.9	We have a dispute	mn98	7	9	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.10	regarding genealogy.	mn98	7	10	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.11	For Bhāradvāja says that	mn98	7	11	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.12	one is a brahmin due to birth,	mn98	7	12	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.13	but I declare it’s because of one’s deeds.	mn98	7	13	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.14	Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate.	mn98	7	14	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.15	Since neither of us was able	mn98	7	15	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.16	to convince the other,	mn98	7	16	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.17	we’ve come to ask you, sir,	mn98	7	17	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.18	renowned as the awakened one.	mn98	7	18	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.19	As people honor with joined palms	mn98	7	19	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.20	the moon on the cusp of waxing,	mn98	7	20	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.21	bowing, they revere	mn98	7	21	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.22	Gotama in the world.	mn98	7	22	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.23	We ask this of Gotama,	mn98	7	23	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.24	the Eye arisen in the world:	mn98	7	24	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.25	is one a brahmin due to birth,	mn98	7	25	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.26	or else because of deeds?	mn98	7	26	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.27	We don’t know, please tell us,	mn98	7	27	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:7.28	so we can recognize a brahmin.”	mn98	7	28	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:8.1	“I shall explain to you,”	mn98	8	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha

mn98:11.115	and have attained the end of rebirth:	mn98	11	115	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:11.116	that’s who I declare a brahmin.	mn98	11	116	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.1	For name and clan are formulated	mn98	12	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.2	as mere convention in the world.	mn98	12	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.3	Produced by mutual agreement,	mn98	12	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.4	they’re formulated for each individual.	mn98	12	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.5	For a long time this misconception	mn98	12	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.6	has prejudiced those who don’t understand.	mn98	12	6	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.7	Ignorant, they declare	mn98	12	7	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.8	that one is a brahmin by birth.	mn98	12	8	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.9	You’re not a brahmin by birth,	mn98	12	9	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.10	nor by birth a non-brahmin.	mn98	12	10	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.11	You’re a brahmin by your deeds,	mn98	12	11	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.12	and by deeds a non-brahmin.	mn98	12	12	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.13	You’re a farmer by your deeds,	mn98	12	13	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.14	by deeds you’re a professional;	mn98	12	14	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.15	you’re a trader by your deeds,	mn98	12	15	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.16	by deeds are you a servant;	mn98	12	16	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.17	you’re a bandit by your deeds,	mn98	12	17	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.18	by deeds you’re a soldier;	mn98	12	18	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.19	you’re a sacrificer by your deeds,	mn98	12	19	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:12.20	by deeds you’re a ruler.	mn98	12	20	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.1	In this way the astute regard deeds	mn98	13	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.2	in accord with truth.	mn98	13	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.3	Seeing dependent origination,	mn98	13	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.4	they’re expert in deeds and their results.	mn98	13	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.5	Deeds make the world go on,	mn98	13	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.6	deeds make people go on;	mn98	13	6	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.7	sentient beings are bound by deeds,	mn98	13	7	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.8	like a moving chariot’s linchpin.	mn98	13	8	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.9	By fervor and spiritual practice,	mn98	13	9	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.10	by restraint and by self-control:	mn98	13	10	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.11	that’s how to become a brahmin,	mn98	13	11	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.12	this is the supreme brahmin.	mn98	13	12	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.13	Accomplished in the three knowledges,	mn98	13	13	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.14	peaceful, with rebirth ended,	mn98	13	14	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.15	know them, Vāseṭṭha,	mn98	13	15	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:13.16	as the Divinity and Sakka to the wise.”	mn98	13	16	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:14.1	When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him,	mn98	14	1	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:14.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn98	14	2	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:14.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn98	14	3	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:14.4	We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn98	14	4	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn98:14.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”	mn98	14	5	mn	98	With Vāseṭṭha
mn99:1.1	So I have heard.	mn99	1	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn99	1	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.1	Now at that time the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī at a certain householder’s home on some business.	mn99	2	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.2	Then Subha said to that householder,	mn99	2	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.3	“Householder, I have heard that	mn99	2	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.4	Sāvatthī does not lack for perfected ones.	mn99	2	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.5	What ascetic or brahmin might we pay homage to today?”	mn99	2	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.6	“Sir, the Buddha is staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn99	2	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:2.7	You can pay homage to him.”	mn99	2	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:3.1	Acknowledging that householder, Subha went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn99	3	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn99	3	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.1	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:	mn99	4	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.2	‘Laypeople succeed in the system of the skillful teaching, not renunciates.’	mn99	4	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.3	What do you say about this?”	mn99	4	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.4	“On this point, student, I speak after analyzing the question,	mn99	4	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.5	not one-sidedly.	mn99	4	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.6	I don’t praise wrong practice for either laypeople or renunciates.	mn99	4	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.7	Because of wrong practice, neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.	mn99	4	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.8	I praise right practice for both laypeople and renunciates.	mn99	4	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:4.9	Because of right practice, both laypeople and renunciates succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.”	mn99	4	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.1	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins say:	mn99	5	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.2	‘Since the work of the lay life has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings it is very fruitful.	mn99	5	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.3	But since the work of the renunciate has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings it is not very fruitful.’	mn99	5	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.4	What do you say about this?”	mn99	5	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.5	“On this point, too, I speak after analyzing the question,	mn99	5	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.6	not one-sidedly.	mn99	5	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.7	Some work has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful.	mn99	5	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.8	Some work has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful.	mn99	5	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.9	Some work has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful.	mn99	5	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:5.10	Some work has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful.	mn99	5	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.1	And what work has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful?	mn99	6	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.2	Farming.	mn99	6	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.3	And what work has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful?	mn99	6	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.4	Again, it is farming.	mn99	6	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.5	And what work has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it fails it’s not very fruitful?	mn99	6	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.6	Trade.	mn99	6	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.7	And what work has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and when it succeeds it is very fruitful?	mn99	6	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:6.8	Again, it’s trade.	mn99	6	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:7.1	The lay life is like farming in that it’s work with many requirements and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;	mn99	7	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:7.3	but when it succeeds it is very fruitful.	mn99	7	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:7.5	The renunciate life is like trade in that it’s work with few requirements and when it fails it’s not very fruitful;	mn99	7	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:7.7	but when it succeeds it is very fruitful.”	mn99	7	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:8.1	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmins prescribe five things for making merit and succeeding in the skillful.”	mn99	8	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:8.3	“If you don’t mind,	mn99	8	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:8.4	please explain these in this assembly.”	mn99	8	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:8.5	“It’s no trouble when good fellows such as yourself are sitting here.”	mn99	8	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:8.6	“Well, speak then, student.”	mn99	8	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.1	“Worthy Gotama, truth is the first thing.	mn99	9	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.2	Fervor is the second thing.	mn99	9	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.3	Chastity is the third thing.	mn99	9	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.4	Recitation is the fourth thing.	mn99	9	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.5	Generosity is the fifth thing.	mn99	9	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.6	These are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful.	mn99	9	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.7	What do you say about this?”	mn99	9	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.8	“Well, student, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:	mn99	9	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.9	‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”	mn99	9	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.10	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn99	9	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.11	“Well, is there even a single tutor of the brahmins, or a tutor’s tutor, or anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors, who says this:	mn99	9	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.12	‘I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight’?”	mn99	9	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.13	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn99	9	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.14	“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.	mn99	9	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.15	Did even they say:	mn99	9	15	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.16	‘We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight’?”	mn99	9	16	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.17	“No, worthy Gotama.”	mn99	9	17	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.18	“So, student, it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins,	mn99	9	18	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.20	not even anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors,	mn99	9	20	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.22	nor even the ancient seers of the brahmins	mn99	9	22	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.23	who says:	mn99	9	23	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.24	‘We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight.’	mn99	9	24	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.25	Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.	mn99	9	25	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:9.26	In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.”	mn99	9	26	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.1	When he said this, Subha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of the simile of the queue of blind men. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying,	mn99	10	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.2	“The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha:	mn99	10	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.3	“Worthy Gotama, the brahmin Pokkharasāti Upamañña of the Subhaga Forest says:	mn99	10	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.4	‘This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins. They claim to have a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn99	10	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.5	But their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow.	mn99	10	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.6	For how on earth can a human being know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?	mn99	10	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:10.7	That is not possible.’”	mn99	10	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:11.1	“But student, does Pokkharasāti understand the minds of all these ascetics and brahmins, having comprehended them with his mind?”	mn99	11	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:11.2	“Worthy Gotama, Pokkharasāti doesn’t even know the mind of his own bonded maid Puṇṇikā, so how could he know all those ascetics and brahmins?”	mn99	11	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.1	“Suppose there was a person blind from birth. They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun.	mn99	12	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.2	They’d say:	mn99	12	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.3	‘There’s no such thing as dark and bright sights, and no-one who sees them.	mn99	12	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.4	There’s no such thing as blue,	mn99	12	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.5	yellow,	mn99	12	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.6	red,	mn99	12	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.7	magenta,	mn99	12	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.8	even and uneven ground,	mn99	12	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.9	stars,	mn99	12	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.10	moon and sun, and no-one who sees these things.	mn99	12	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.11	I don’t know it or see it,	mn99	12	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.12	therefore it doesn’t exist.’	mn99	12	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.13	Would they be speaking rightly?”	mn99	12	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.14	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn99	12	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.15	There are such things as dark and bright sights, and one who sees them.	mn99	12	15	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.16	There is blue,	mn99	12	16	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.17	yellow,	mn99	12	17	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.18	red,	mn99	12	18	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.19	magenta,	mn99	12	19	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.20	even and uneven ground,	mn99	12	20	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.21	stars,	mn99	12	21	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.22	moon and sun, and one who sees these things.	mn99	12	22	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.23	So it’s not right to say this: ‘I don’t know it or see it,	mn99	12	23	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:12.24	therefore it doesn’t exist.’”	mn99	12	24	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.1	“In the same way, Pokkharasāti is blind and sightless.	mn99	13	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.2	It is quite impossible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn99	13	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.3	What do you think, student?	mn99	13	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.4	There are well-to-do brahmins of Kosala such as	mn99	13	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.5	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, and your father Todeyya. What’s better for them: that their speech agrees or disagrees with the consensus of opinion?”	mn99	13	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.6	“That it agrees, worthy Gotama.”	mn99	13	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.7	“What’s better for them: that their speech is thoughtful or thoughtless?”	mn99	13	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.8	“That it is thoughtful.”	mn99	13	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.9	“What’s better for them: that their speech follows reflection or is unreflective?”	mn99	13	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.10	“That it follows reflection.”	mn99	13	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.11	“What’s better for them: that their speech is beneficial or worthless?”	mn99	13	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:13.12	“That it’s beneficial.”	mn99	13	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.1	“What do you think, student?	mn99	14	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.2	If this is so, does Pokkharasāti’s speech agree or disagree with the consensus of opinion?”	mn99	14	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.3	“It disagrees, worthy Gotama.”	mn99	14	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.4	“Is it thoughtful or thoughtless?”	mn99	14	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.5	“Thoughtless.”	mn99	14	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.6	“Is it reflective or unreflective?”	mn99	14	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.7	“Unreflective.”	mn99	14	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.8	“Is it beneficial or worthless?”	mn99	14	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:14.9	“Worthless.”	mn99	14	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.1	“Student, there are these five hindrances.	mn99	15	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.2	What five?	mn99	15	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.3	The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.	mn99	15	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.4	These are the five hindrances.	mn99	15	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.5	Pokkharasāti is veiled, shrouded, covered, and engulfed by these five hindrances.	mn99	15	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:15.6	It is quite impossible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn99	15	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.1	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn99	16	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.2	What five?	mn99	16	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.3	There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn99	16	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.4	There are sounds known by the ear …	mn99	16	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.5	smells known by the nose …	mn99	16	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.6	tastes known by the tongue …	mn99	16	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.7	touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn99	16	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn99	16	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.9	Pokkharasāti enjoys himself with these five kinds of sensual stimulation, tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape.	mn99	16	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:16.10	It is quite impossible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.	mn99	16	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.1	What do you think, student?	mn99	17	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.2	Which would have better flames, color, and radiance: a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel, or one that does not?”	mn99	17	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.3	“If it were possible for a fire to burn without depending on grass and logs as fuel, that would have better flames, color, and radiance.”	mn99	17	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.4	“But it isn’t possible, except by psychic power.	mn99	17	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.5	Rapture that depends on the five kinds of sensual stimulation is like a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel.	mn99	17	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.6	Rapture that’s apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities is like a fire that doesn’t depend on grass and logs as fuel.	mn99	17	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.7	And what is rapture that’s apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities?	mn99	17	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.8	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn99	17	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.9	This is rapture that’s apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities.	mn99	17	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.10	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn99	17	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:17.11	This too is rapture that’s apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities.	mn99	17	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:18.1	Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful, which do they say is the most fruitful?”	mn99	18	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:18.2	“Generosity.”	mn99	18	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.1	“What do you think, student?	mn99	19	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.2	Suppose a brahmin was setting up a big sacrifice.	mn99	19	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.3	Then two brahmins came along,	mn99	19	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.4	thinking to participate.	mn99	19	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.5	Then one of those brahmins thought:	mn99	19	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.6	‘Oh, I hope that I alone get the best seat, the best drink, and the best almsfood in the refectory, not some other brahmin.’	mn99	19	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.7	But it’s possible that some other brahmin gets the best seat, the best drink, and the best almsfood in the refectory.	mn99	19	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.8	Thinking, ‘Some other brahmin has got the best seat, the best drink, the best almsfood,’	mn99	19	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.9	they get angry and bitter.	mn99	19	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.10	What do the brahmins say is the result of this?”	mn99	19	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.11	“Worthy Gotama, brahmins don’t give gifts so that	mn99	19	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.12	others will get angry and upset.	mn99	19	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.13	Rather, they give only out of sympathy.”	mn99	19	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.14	“In that case, isn’t compassion a sixth ground for making merit?”	mn99	19	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:19.16	“In that case, compassion is a sixth ground for making merit.”	mn99	19	16	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.1	“Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful, where do you usually find them:	mn99	20	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.2	among laypeople or renunciates?”	mn99	20	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.3	“Mostly among renunciates, and less so among lay people.	mn99	20	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.4	For a lay person has many requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and they can’t always tell the truth,	mn99	20	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.6	be fervent,	mn99	20	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.7	be chaste,	mn99	20	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.8	do lots of recitation,	mn99	20	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.9	or be very generous.	mn99	20	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.10	But a renunciate has few requirements, duties, issues, and undertakings, and they can always tell the truth, be fervent,	mn99	20	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.11	be chaste,	mn99	20	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.12	do lots of recitation,	mn99	20	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.13	and be very generous.	mn99	20	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:20.14	Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful, I usually find them among renunciates, and less so among laypeople.”	mn99	20	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.1	“I say that the five things prescribed by the brahmins for making merit are prerequisites of the mind for	mn99	21	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.2	developing a mind free of enmity and ill will.	mn99	21	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.3	Take a mendicant who speaks the truth.	mn99	21	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.4	Thinking, ‘I’m truthful,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.	mn99	21	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.5	And I say that joy connected with the skillful is a prerequisite of the mind for	mn99	21	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.6	developing a mind free of enmity and ill will.	mn99	21	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.7	Take a mendicant who is fervent …	mn99	21	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.8	is chaste …	mn99	21	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:21.9	does lots of recitation …	mn99	21	9	mn	99	With Subha

mn99:21.15	developing a mind free of enmity and ill will.”	mn99	21	15	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.1	When he had spoken, Subha said to him,	mn99	22	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.2	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard that	mn99	22	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.3	the ascetic Gotama knows a path to company with divinity.”	mn99	22	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.4	“What do you think, student?	mn99	22	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.5	Is the village of Naḷakāra nearby?”	mn99	22	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.6	“Yes it is, sir.”	mn99	22	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.7	“What do you think, student? Suppose a person was born and raised in Naḷakāra.	mn99	22	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.8	And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Naḷakāra.	mn99	22	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.9	Would they be slow or hesitant to answer?”	mn99	22	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.10	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn99	22	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.11	Why is that?	mn99	22	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.12	Because they were born and raised in Naḷakāra. They’re well acquainted with all the roads to the village.”	mn99	22	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.13	“Still, it’s possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer. But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the realm of divinity or the practice that leads to the realm of divinity.	mn99	22	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:22.14	I understand divinity, the realm of divinity, and the practice that leads to the realm of divinity, practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the realm of divinity.”	mn99	22	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.1	“Worthy Gotama, I have heard that	mn99	23	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.2	the ascetic Gotama teaches a path to company with divinity.	mn99	23	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.3	Please teach me that path.”	mn99	23	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.4	“Well then, student, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn99	23	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.5	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Subha.	mn99	23	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:23.6	The Buddha said this:	mn99	23	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.1	“And what is a path to company with divinity?	mn99	24	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.2	Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn99	24	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.3	When the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	mn99	24	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.4	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	mn99	24	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.5	In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	mn99	24	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:24.6	This is a path to company with divinity.	mn99	24	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.1	Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn99	25-27	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.2	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	mn99	25-27	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn99	25-27	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.4	When the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	mn99	25-27	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.5	Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters.	mn99	25-27	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.6	In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there.	mn99	25-27	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:25-27.7	This too is a path to company with divinity.”	mn99	25-27	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.1	When he had spoken, Subha said to him,	mn99	28	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn99	28	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	mn99	28	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn99	28	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.	mn99	28	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.6	Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go.	mn99	28	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:28.7	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn99	28	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:29.1	“Please, student, go at your convenience.”	mn99	29	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:29.2	And then Subha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	mn99	29	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.1	Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.	mn99	30	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.2	He saw the student Subha coming off in the distance,	mn99	30	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.3	and said to him,	mn99	30	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.4	“So, worthy Bhāradvāja, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	mn99	30	4	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.5	“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”	mn99	30	5	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.6	“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?”	mn99	30	6	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.7	“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?	mn99	30	7	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.8	You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.”	mn99	30	8	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.9	“Worthy Bhāradvāja praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed.”	mn99	30	9	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.10	“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama?	mn99	30	10	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.11	He is praised by the praised as the best among gods and humans.	mn99	30	11	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.12	The five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful	mn99	30	12	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.13	he says are prerequisites of the mind for	mn99	30	13	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:30.14	developing a mind free of enmity and ill will.”	mn99	30	14	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:31.1	When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times,	mn99	31	1	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:31.2	“King Pasenadi of Kosala is lucky, so very lucky	mn99	31	2	mn	99	With Subha
mn99:31.3	that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is living in his realm!”	mn99	31	3	mn	99	With Subha
mn100:1.1	So I have heard.	mn100	1	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn100	1	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:2.1	Now at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa. She was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	mn100	2	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:2.2	Once, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	mn100	2	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:2.3	“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn100	2	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:2.4	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	mn100	2	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:2.5	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!”	mn100	2	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.1	Now at that time the student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.	mn100	3	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.2	Hearing Dhanañjānī’s exclamation,	mn100	3	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.3	he said to her,	mn100	3	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.4	“The brahmin lady Dhanañjānī is a disgrace! Though brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are found, she praises that shaveling, that fake ascetic.”	mn100	3	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.5	“But dearest boy, you don’t understand the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.	mn100	3	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.6	If you did, you’d never think of abusing or insulting him.”	mn100	3	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.7	“Well then, ma’am, let me know when the Buddha arrives in Caṇḍalakappa.”	mn100	3	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:3.8	“I will, dearest,” she replied.	mn100	3	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:4.1	And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands, arrived at Caṇḍalakappa,	mn100	4	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:4.2	where he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahmins.	mn100	4	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:5.1	Dhanañjānī heard that he had arrived.	mn100	5	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:5.2	So she went to Saṅgārava and told him, adding,	mn100	5	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:5.4	“Please, dearest boy, go at your convenience.”	mn100	5	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:5.5	“Yes, ma’am,” replied Saṅgārava. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	mn100	5	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:5.6	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn100	5	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:6.1	“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.	mn100	6	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:6.2	Where do you stand regarding these?”	mn100	6	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.1	“I say there is a diversity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life.	mn100	7	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.2	There are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmitters.	mn100	7	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.3	Through oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	mn100	7	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.4	For example, the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas.	mn100	7	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.5	There are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	mn100	7	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.6	For example, those who rely on logic and inquiry.	mn100	7	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.7	There are some ascetics and brahmins who, having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another, claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life.	mn100	7	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:7.8	I am one of those.	mn100	7	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:8.1	And here’s a way to understand that I am one of them.	mn100	8	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.1	Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:	mn100	9	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.2	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	mn100	9	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.3	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn100	9	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.4	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn100	9	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.5	Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn100	9	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.6	Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn100	9	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.7	‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn100	9	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.8	Āḷāra Kālāma replied,	mn100	9	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.9	‘Stay, venerable.	mn100	9	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.10	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn100	9	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.11	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn100	9	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.12	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn100	9	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.13	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	9	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.14	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn100	9	14	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:9.15	Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn100	9	15	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.1	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him:	mn100	10	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.2	‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’	mn100	10	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.3	When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.	mn100	10	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.4	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	10	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.5	‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,	mn100	10	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.6	energy,	mn100	10	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.7	mindfulness,	mn100	10	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.8	immersion,	mn100	10	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.9	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn100	10	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.10	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’	mn100	10	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.11	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn100	10	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.12	So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,	mn100	10	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.13	‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’	mn100	10	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.14	‘I have, reverend.’	mn100	10	14	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.15	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn100	10	15	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.16	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn100	10	16	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.17	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn100	10	17	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.18	So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn100	10	18	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.19	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.	mn100	10	19	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.20	So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.	mn100	10	20	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.21	I am like you and you are like me.	mn100	10	21	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.22	Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’	mn100	10	22	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.23	And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.	mn100	10	23	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.24	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	10	24	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.25	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’	mn100	10	25	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:10.26	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn100	10	26	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn100	11	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.2	‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’	mn100	11	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.3	Uddaka replied,	mn100	11	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.4	‘Stay, venerable.	mn100	11	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.5	This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’	mn100	11	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.6	I quickly memorized that teaching.	mn100	11	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.7	As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.	mn100	11	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.8	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	11	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.9	‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”	mn100	11	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.10	Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’	mn100	11	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.11	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn100	11	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.12	‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’	mn100	11	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.13	When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn100	11	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.14	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	11	14	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.15	‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,	mn100	11	15	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.16	energy,	mn100	11	16	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.17	mindfulness,	mn100	11	17	mn	100	With Saṅgārava

mn100:11.19	and wisdom; I too have these things.	mn100	11	19	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.20	Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’	mn100	11	20	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:11.21	I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.	mn100	11	21	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.1	So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,	mn100	12	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.2	‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’	mn100	12	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.3	‘He had, reverend.’	mn100	12	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.4	‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’	mn100	12	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.5	‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate	mn100	12	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.6	to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!	mn100	12	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.7	So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it.	mn100	12	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.8	The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.	mn100	12	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.9	So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.	mn100	12	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.10	Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.	mn100	12	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.11	Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’	mn100	12	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.12	And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor, and honored me with lofty praise.	mn100	12	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.13	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	12	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.14	‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	mn100	12	14	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:12.15	Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.	mn100	12	15	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.1	I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā.	mn100	13	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.2	There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms.	mn100	13	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.3	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	13	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.4	‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms.	mn100	13	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.5	This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’	mn100	13	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.6	So I sat down right there, thinking:	mn100	13	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:13.7	‘This is good enough for striving.’	mn100	13	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.1	And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.	mn100	14	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.	mn100	14	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn100	14	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn100	14	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	mn100	14	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn100	14	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn100	14	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.8	Why is that?	mn100	14	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.9	Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.	mn100	14	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”	mn100	14	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.11	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.	mn100	14	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:14.12	This was the first example that occurred to me.	mn100	14	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.1	Then a second example occurred to me.	mn100	15	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.2	Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn100	15	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn100	15	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn100	15	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	mn100	15	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.6	By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn100	15	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.7	“No, worthy Gotama.	mn100	15	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.8	Why is that?	mn100	15	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.9	Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.	mn100	15	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:15.10	That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.” “In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

mn100:15.11	This was the second example that occurred to me.	mn100	15	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.1	Then a third example occurred to me.	mn100	16	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.2	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.	mn100	16	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.3	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn100	16	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.4	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn100	16	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.5	What do you think, Bhāradvāja?	mn100	16	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.6	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn100	16	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.7	“Yes, worthy Gotama.	mn100	16	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.8	Why is that?	mn100	16	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.9	Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”	mn100	16	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.10	“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

mn100:16.11	This was the third example that occurred to me.	mn100	16	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:16.12	These are the three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.	mn100	16	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	17	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.2	‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’	mn100	17	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.3	So that’s what I did,	mn100	17	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.4	until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn100	17	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.5	It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them.	mn100	17	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.6	In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.	mn100	17	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:17.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	17	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	18	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.2	‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’	mn100	18	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn100	18	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.4	But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,	mn100	18	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.5	like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.	mn100	18	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:18.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	18	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	19	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn100	19	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn100	19	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.4	But then strong winds ground my head,	mn100	19	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.5	like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.	mn100	19	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:19.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	19	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	20	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn100	20	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn100	20	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.4	But then I got a severe headache,	mn100	20	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.5	like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	mn100	20	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:20.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	20	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	21	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn100	21	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn100	21	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.4	But then strong winds carved up my belly,	mn100	21	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.5	like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn100	21	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:21.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	21	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	22	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.2	‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’	mn100	22	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.3	So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.	mn100	22	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.4	But then there was an intense burning in my body,	mn100	22	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.5	like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	mn100	22	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:22.7	My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.	mn100	22	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.1	Then some deities saw me and said,	mn100	23	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.2	‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’	mn100	23	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.3	Others said,	mn100	23	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.4	‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’	mn100	23	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.5	Others said,	mn100	23	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:23.6	‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’	mn100	23	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	24	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.2	‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’	mn100	24	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.3	But deities came to me and said,	mn100	24	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.4	‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food.	mn100	24	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.5	If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’	mn100	24	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.7	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	24	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.8	‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’	mn100	24	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:24.10	So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’	mn100	24	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	25	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.2	‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’	mn100	25	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.3	So that’s what I did,	mn100	25	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.4	until my body became extremely emaciated.	mn100	25	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.5	Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man,	mn100	25	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.6	my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,	mn100	25	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.7	my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,	mn100	25	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.8	and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.	mn100	25	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.9	Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.	mn100	25	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.10	Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.	mn100	25	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.11	Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.	mn100	25	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.12	Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.	mn100	25	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:25.13	Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.	mn100	25	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:26.1	Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’	mn100	26	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:26.2	Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’	mn100	26	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:26.3	Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’	mn100	26	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:26.4	That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.	mn100	26	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:27.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	27	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:27.2	‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.	mn100	27	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:27.5	But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work.	mn100	27	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:27.6	Could there be another path to awakening?’	mn100	27	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:28.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	28	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:28.2	‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn100	28	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:28.3	Could that be the path to awakening?’	mn100	28	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:28.4	Stemming from that memory came the understanding:	mn100	28	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:28.5	‘*That* is the path to awakening!’	mn100	28	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:29.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	29	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:29.2	‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’	mn100	29	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:29.3	I thought,	mn100	29	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:29.4	‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’	mn100	29	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.1	Then it occurred to me,	mn100	30	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.2	‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’	mn100	30	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.4	So I ate some solid food.	mn100	30	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.5	Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,	mn100	30	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.6	‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’	mn100	30	6	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.7	But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,	mn100	30	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:30.8	‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’	mn100	30	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:31-33.1	After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption …	mn100	31-33	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:31-33.2	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …	mn100	31-33	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:31-33.3	third absorption …	mn100	31-33	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:31-33.4	fourth absorption.	mn100	31-33	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:34.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.	mn100	34	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:34.2	I recollected many past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn100	34	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:35.1	This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.	mn100	35	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:35.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn100	35	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:36-38.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn100	36-38	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:36-38.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds …	mn100	36-38	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:36-38.3	This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.	mn100	36-38	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:36-38.4	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	mn100	36-38	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:39.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn100	39	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:39.2	I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn100	39	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:39.3	I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn100	39	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:40.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn100	40	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:40.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	mn100	40	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:40.3	I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’	mn100	40	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:41.1	This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.	mn100	41	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:41.2	Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.”	mn100	41	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.1	When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,	mn100	42	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.2	“The striving of the worthy Gotama was indeed assiduous and that of a true person,	mn100	42	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.3	since he is a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.	mn100	42	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.4	But worthy Gotama, do gods survive?”	mn100	42	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.5	“I’ve understood about gods in terms of causes.”	mn100	42	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.7	“But worthy Gotama, when asked ‘Do gods survive?’ why did you say that you have understood about gods in terms of causes?	mn100	42	7	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.8	That being so, is it not hollow and false?”	mn100	42	8	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.9	“When asked ‘Do gods survive’, whether you reply ‘Gods survive’ or ‘I’ve understood in terms of causes’	mn100	42	9	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.10	a sensible person would come to the categorical conclusion in this matter that	mn100	42	10	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.11	gods survive.”	mn100	42	11	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.12	“But why didn’t you say that in the first place?”	mn100	42	12	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:42.13	“It is agreed by the eminent in the world that gods survive.”	mn100	42	13	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:43.1	When he had spoken, Saṅgārava said to the Buddha,	mn100	43	1	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:43.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn100	43	2	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:43.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	mn100	43	3	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:43.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn100	43	4	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn100:43.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn100	43	5	mn	100	With Saṅgārava
mn101:1.1	So I have heard.	mn101	1	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Devadaha.	mn101	1	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn101	1	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.1	“Mendicants!”	mn101	2	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.2	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn101	2	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.3	The Buddha said this:	mn101	2	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.4	“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:	mn101	2	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.5	‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.	mn101	2	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.6	So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.	mn101	2	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.7	With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.’	mn101	2	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:2.8	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	mn101	2	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:3.1	I’ve gone up to the Jain ascetics who say this and said,	mn101	3	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:3.2	‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’	mn101	3	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:3.6	They admitted that it is.	mn101	3	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.1	I said to them,	mn101	4	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.2	‘But reverends, do you know	mn101	4	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.3	for sure that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you did not exist?’	mn101	4	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.4	‘No we don’t, reverend.’	mn101	4	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.5	‘But reverends, do you know	mn101	4	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.6	for sure that you did bad deeds in the past?’	mn101	4	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.7	‘No we don’t, reverend.’	mn101	4	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.8	‘But reverends, do you know	mn101	4	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.9	that you did such and such bad deeds?’	mn101	4	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.10	‘No we don’t, reverend.’	mn101	4	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.11	‘But reverends, do you know	mn101	4	11	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.12	that so much suffering has already been worn away? Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away? Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away?’	mn101	4	12	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.13	‘No we don’t, reverend.’	mn101	4	13	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.14	‘But reverends, do you know	mn101	4	14	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.15	about giving up unskillful qualities in this very life and embracing skillful qualities?’	mn101	4	15	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:4.16	‘No we don’t, reverend.’	mn101	4	16	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:5.1	‘So it seems that you don’t know any of these things.	mn101	5	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:5.7	In that case, it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.	mn101	5	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:6.1	Now, supposing you did know these things.	mn101	6	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:6.7	In that case, it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.	mn101	6	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.1	Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,	mn101	7	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.2	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.3	Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.	mn101	7	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.4	The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,	mn101	7	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.5	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.6	They’d probe for the arrow,	mn101	7	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.7	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.8	They’d extract the arrow,	mn101	7	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.9	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.10	They’d apply cauterizing medicine to the wound,	mn101	7	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.11	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	11	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.12	After some time that wound would be healed and the skin regrown. They’d be healthy, happy, autonomous, master of themselves, able to go where they wanted.	mn101	7	12	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.13	They’d think,	mn101	7	13	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.14	“Earlier I was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,	mn101	7	14	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.15	causing painful feelings, sharp and severe.	mn101	7	15	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.16	My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin got a surgeon to treat me.	mn101	7	16	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.17	At each step, the treatment was painful.	mn101	7	17	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:7.25	But these days that wound is healed and the skin regrown. I’m healthy, happy, autonomous, my own master, able to go where I want.”	mn101	7	25	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:8.1	In the same way, reverends, if you knew about these things,	mn101	8	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:8.7	it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.	mn101	8	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:9.1	But since you don’t know any of these things,	mn101	9	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:9.7	it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.’	mn101	9	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.1	When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me,	mn101	10	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.2	‘Reverend, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:	mn101	10	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.3	“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”	mn101	10	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.4	He says:	mn101	10	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.5	“O reverend Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.	mn101	10	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.6	And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future.	mn101	10	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.7	So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.	mn101	10	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.8	With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”	mn101	10	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:10.9	We endorse and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.’	mn101	10	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.1	When they said this, I said to them,	mn101	11	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.2	‘These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways.	mn101	11	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.3	What five?	mn101	11	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.4	Faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, and acceptance of a view after deliberation.	mn101	11	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.5	These are the five things that can be seen to turn out in two different ways.	mn101	11	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.6	In this case, what faith in your teacher do you have when it comes to the past? What endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation?’	mn101	11	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:11.7	When I said this, I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains.	mn101	11	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.1	Furthermore, I said to those Jain ascetics,	mn101	12	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.2	‘What do you think, reverends?	mn101	12	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.3	At a time of intense exertion and striving do you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?	mn101	12	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.4	Whereas at a time without intense exertion and striving do you not suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’	mn101	12	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.5	‘Reverend Gotama, at a time of intense exertion we suffer painful, sharp feelings due to overexertion,	mn101	12	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:12.6	not without intense exertion.’	mn101	12	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:13.1	‘So it seems that only at a time of intense exertion do you suffer painful, sharp feelings due to overexertion,	mn101	13	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:13.2	not without intense exertion.	mn101	13	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:13.3	In that case, it’s not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare:	mn101	13	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:13.4	“Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds. …”	mn101	13	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:14.1	If at a time of intense exertion you did not suffer painful, sharp feelings due to overexertion,	mn101	14	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:14.2	and if without intense exertion you did experience such feelings,	mn101	14	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:14.3	it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this.	mn101	14	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:15.1	But since this is not the case,	mn101	15	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:15.3	aren’t you experiencing painful, sharp feelings due only to your own exertion, which out of ignorance, unknowing, and confusion you misconstrue to imply:	mn101	15	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:15.4	“Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds. …”?’	mn101	15	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:15.7	When I said this, I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains.	mn101	15	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:16.1	Furthermore, I said to those Jain ascetics,	mn101	16	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:16.2	‘What do you think, reverends? If a deed is to be experienced in this life, can exertion make it be experienced in lives to come?’	mn101	16	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:16.3	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	16	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:16.4	‘But if a deed is to be experienced in lives to come, can exertion make it be experienced in this life?’	mn101	16	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:16.5	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	16	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:17.1	‘What do you think, reverends? If a deed is to be experienced as pleasure, can exertion make it be experienced as pain?’	mn101	17	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:17.2	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	17	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:17.3	‘But if a deed is to be experienced as pain, can exertion make it be experienced as pleasure?’	mn101	17	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:17.4	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	17	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:18.1	‘What do you think, reverends? If a deed is to be experienced when fully ripened, can exertion make it be experienced when not fully ripened?’	mn101	18	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:18.2	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	18	2	mn	101	At Devadaha

mn101:20.4	‘No, reverend.’	mn101	20	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:21.1	‘So it seems that exertion cannot change the way deeds are experienced in any of these ways.	mn101	21	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:21.2	This being so, your exertion and striving are fruitless.’	mn101	21	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.1	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	mn101	22	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.2	Saying this, the Jain ascetics deserve rebuttal and criticism on ten legitimate grounds.	mn101	22	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.3	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds,	mn101	22	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.4	clearly the Jains have done bad deeds in the past, since they now experience such intense pain.	mn101	22	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.5	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of God Almighty’s creation,	mn101	22	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.6	clearly the Jains were created by a bad God, since they now experience such intense pain.	mn101	22	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.7	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and nature,	mn101	22	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.8	clearly the Jains arise from bad circumstances, since they now experience such intense pain.	mn101	22	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.9	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the class of rebirth,	mn101	22	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.10	clearly the Jains have been reborn in a bad class, since they now experience such intense pain.	mn101	22	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.11	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of exertion in this life,	mn101	22	11	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.12	clearly the Jains exert themselves badly in this life, since they now experience such intense pain.	mn101	22	12	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.13	The Jains deserve criticism whether or not sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds,	mn101	22	13	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.15	or God Almighty’s creation,	mn101	22	15	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.17	or circumstance and nature,	mn101	22	17	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.19	or class of rebirth,	mn101	22	19	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.21	or exertion in this life.	mn101	22	21	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.23	Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics.	mn101	22	23	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.24	The Jain ascetics who say this deserve rebuttal and criticism on these ten legitimate grounds.	mn101	22	24	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:22.25	That’s how exertion and striving is fruitless.	mn101	22	25	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.1	And how is exertion and striving fruitful?	mn101	23	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.2	It’s when a mendicant doesn’t bring suffering upon themselves; and they don’t forsake legitimate pleasure, but they’re not besotted with that pleasure.	mn101	23	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.3	They understand:	mn101	23	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.4	‘When I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering. But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering.’	mn101	23	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.5	So they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate.	mn101	23	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.7	Through active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of suffering,	mn101	23	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.8	and so that suffering is worn away.	mn101	23	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.9	Through developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of suffering,	mn101	23	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:23.10	and so that suffering is worn away.	mn101	23	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.1	Suppose a man is in love with a woman, full of intense desire and lust.	mn101	24	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.2	Then he sees her standing together with another man, chatting, giggling, and laughing.	mn101	24	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.3	What do you think, mendicants?	mn101	24	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.4	Would that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress for him?”	mn101	24	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.5	“Yes, sir.	mn101	24	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.6	Why is that?	mn101	24	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:24.7	Because that man is in love with that woman, full of intense desire and lust.”	mn101	24	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.1	“Then that man might think:	mn101	25	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.2	‘I’m in love with that woman, full of intense desire and lust.	mn101	25	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.3	When I saw her standing together with another man, chatting, giggling, and laughing, it gave rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress for me.	mn101	25	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.4	Why don’t I give up that desire and lust for that woman?’	mn101	25	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.5	So that’s what he did.	mn101	25	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.6	Some time later he sees her again standing together with another man, chatting, giggling, and laughing.	mn101	25	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.7	What do you think, mendicants?	mn101	25	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.8	Would that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress for him?”	mn101	25	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.9	“No, sir.	mn101	25	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.10	Why is that?	mn101	25	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:25.11	Because he no longer desires that woman.”	mn101	25	11	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.1	“In the same way, a mendicant doesn’t bring suffering upon themselves; and they don’t forsake legitimate pleasure, but they’re not besotted with that pleasure.	mn101	26	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.2	They understand:	mn101	26	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.3	‘When I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering. But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering.’	mn101	26	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.4	So they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate.	mn101	26	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.6	Through active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of suffering,	mn101	26	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.7	and so that suffering is worn away.	mn101	26	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.8	Through developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of suffering,	mn101	26	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.9	and so that suffering is worn away.	mn101	26	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:26.10	That’s how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	26	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.1	Furthermore, a mendicant reflects:	mn101	27	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.2	‘When I live as I please, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.	mn101	27	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.3	But when I strive painfully, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow.	mn101	27	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.4	Why don’t I strive painfully?’	mn101	27	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.5	So that’s what they do,	mn101	27	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.6	and as they do so unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow.	mn101	27	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.7	After some time, they no longer strive painfully.	mn101	27	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.8	Why is that?	mn101	27	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:27.9	Because they have accomplished the goal for which they strived painfully.	mn101	27	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:28.1	Suppose an arrowsmith was heating an arrow shaft between two firebrands, making it straight and fit for use.	mn101	28	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.1	After it’s been made straight and fit for use, they’d no longer heat it to make it straight and fit for use.	mn101	29	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.2	Why is that?	mn101	29	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.3	Because they have accomplished the goal for which they heated it.	mn101	29	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.5	In the same way, a mendicant reflects:	mn101	29	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.6	‘When I live as I please, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.	mn101	29	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.7	But when I strive painfully, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow.	mn101	29	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.8	Why don’t I strive painfully?’ …	mn101	29	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.14	After some time, they no longer strive painfully.	mn101	29	14	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:29.15	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	29	15	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:30.1	Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	mn101	30	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:30.2	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn101	30	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:30.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn101	30	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.1	A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family.	mn101	31	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.2	They gain faith in the Realized One,	mn101	31	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.3	and reflect:	mn101	31	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.4	‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open.	mn101	31	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.5	It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	mn101	31	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.6	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’	mn101	31	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:31.7	After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	mn101	31	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.1	Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.	mn101	32	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.2	They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.	mn101	32	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.3	They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.	mn101	32	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.4	They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.	mn101	32	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.5	They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.	mn101	32	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.6	They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	mn101	32	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.7	They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.	mn101	32	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:32.8	They refrain from injuring plants and seeds.	mn101	32	8	mn	101	At Devadaha

mn101:33.1	They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	mn101	33	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:33.2	They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.	mn101	33	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:33.3	In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.	mn101	33	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:33.4	When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.	mn101	33	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:34.1	When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn101	34	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:34.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	mn101	34	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:34.3	When they hear a sound with their ears …	mn101	34	3	mn	101	At Devadaha

mn101:34.8	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.	mn101	34	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:34.9	When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.	mn101	34	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:35.1	They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	mn101	35	1	mn	101	At Devadaha

mn101:36.2	they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn101	36	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:36.3	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	mn101	36	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:37.1	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	mn101	37	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:37.2	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	mn101	37	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:37.3	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	mn101	37	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:37.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	mn101	37	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:37.5	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	mn101	37	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:38.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn101	38	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:38.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn101	38	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:38.3	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	38	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:39.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn101	39	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:39.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	39	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:40.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn101	40	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:40.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	40	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:41.1	Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn101	41	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:41.2	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	41	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:42.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.	mn101	42	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:42.2	They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn101	42	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:42.3	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	42	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:43.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.	mn101	43	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:43.2	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn101	43	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:43.3	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	43	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:44.1	When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn101	44	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:44.2	They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.	mn101	44	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:44.3	They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.	mn101	44	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:45.1	Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn101	45	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:45.2	When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.	mn101	45	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:45.3	They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’	mn101	45	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:45.4	That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful.	mn101	45	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.1	Such is the doctrine of the Realized One.	mn101	46	1	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.2	Saying this, the Realized One deserves praise on ten legitimate grounds.	mn101	46	2	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.3	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds,	mn101	46	3	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.4	clearly the Realized One has done good deeds in the past, since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure.	mn101	46	4	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.5	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of God Almighty’s creation,	mn101	46	5	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.6	clearly the Realized One was created by a good God, since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure.	mn101	46	6	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.7	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and nature,	mn101	46	7	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.8	clearly the Realized One arises from good circumstances, since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure.	mn101	46	8	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.9	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the class of rebirth,	mn101	46	9	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.10	clearly the Realized One was reborn in a good class, since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure.	mn101	46	10	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.11	If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of exertion in this life,	mn101	46	11	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.12	clearly the Realized One exerts himself well in this life, since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure.	mn101	46	12	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.13	The Realized One deserves praise whether or not sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds,	mn101	46	13	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.15	or God Almighty’s creation,	mn101	46	15	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.17	or circumstance and nature,	mn101	46	17	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.19	or class of rebirth,	mn101	46	19	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.22	or exertion in this life.	mn101	46	22	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.23	Such is the doctrine of the Realized One.	mn101	46	23	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.24	Saying this, the Realized One deserves praise on these ten legitimate grounds.”	mn101	46	24	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.25	That is what the Buddha said.	mn101	46	25	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn101:46.26	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn101	46	26	mn	101	At Devadaha
mn102:1.1	So I have heard.	mn102	1	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn102	1	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn102	1	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn102	1	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn102	1	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn102	1	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.1	“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who speculate and theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future.	mn102	2	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.2	Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and healthy after death.’	mn102	2	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.4	Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and healthy after death.’	mn102	2	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.6	Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death.’	mn102	2	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.8	But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in this life.	mn102	2	8	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.9	Thus they assert an existent self that is free of disease after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; while some propose extinguishment in this life.	mn102	2	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.10	In this way five become three, and three become five.	mn102	2	10	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:2.11	This is the summary recital of the five and three.	mn102	2	11	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:3.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and imperturbable.	mn102	3	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:4.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	4	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:4.2	There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.	mn102	4	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:4.4	Or some, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and imperturbable. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity.	mn102	4	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:4.5	‘That much is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	4	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:4.6	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	4	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:5.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	mn102	5	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:6.1	So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death.	mn102	6	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:6.2	Why is that?	mn102	6	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:6.3	Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.	mn102	6	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	7	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.2	There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	mn102	7	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.3	But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this:	mn102	7	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.4	‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’	mn102	7	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.5	That is not possible.	mn102	7	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.6	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	7	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:7.7	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	7	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:8.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	mn102	8	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:9.1	So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, as well as those who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death.	mn102	9	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:9.2	Why is that?	mn102	9	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:9.3	Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart; that non-perception is a stupor; and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.	mn102	9	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	10	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.2	There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless.	mn102	10	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.3	Some ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is able to be seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach.	mn102	10	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.4	For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena,	mn102	10	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.5	but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena.	mn102	10	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.6	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	10	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:10.7	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	10	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:11.1	Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being reject those who assert a self that is healthy after death, whether percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient non-percipient.	mn102	11	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:11.2	Why is that?	mn102	11	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:11.3	Because they think: ‘All of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to heading upstream:	mn102	11	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:11.4	“After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!”	mn102	11	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.1	Suppose a trader was going to market, thinking:	mn102	12	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.2	“With this, that shall be mine! This way, I shall get that!”	mn102	12	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.3	In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins seem to be like traders when they say:	mn102	12	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.4	“After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!”’	mn102	12	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.5	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	12	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.6	The ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being; from fear and disgust with substantial reality, they just keep running and circling around substantial reality.	mn102	12	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.7	Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. It would just keeping running and circling around that post or pillar.	mn102	12	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.8	In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins, from fear and disgust with substantial reality, just keep running and circling around substantial reality.	mn102	12	8	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.9	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	12	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:12.10	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	12	10	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:13.1	Whatever ascetics and brahmins speculate and theorize about the future, and propose various hypotheses concerning the future, all of them propose one or other of these five theses.	mn102	13	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and propose various hypotheses concerning the past. They propose the following, each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrong.	mn102	14	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.2	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal.’	mn102	14	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.3	‘The self and the cosmos are not eternal.’	mn102	14	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.4	‘The self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal.’	mn102	14	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.5	‘The self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal.’	mn102	14	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.6	‘The self and the cosmos are finite.’	mn102	14	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.7	‘The self and the cosmos are infinite.’	mn102	14	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.8	‘The self and the cosmos are both finite and infinite.’	mn102	14	8	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.9	‘The self and the cosmos are neither finite nor infinite.’	mn102	14	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.10	‘The self and the cosmos are unified in perception.’	mn102	14	10	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.11	‘The self and the cosmos are diverse in perception.’	mn102	14	11	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.12	‘The self and the cosmos have limited perception.’	mn102	14	12	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.13	‘The self and the cosmos have limitless perception.’	mn102	14	13	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.14	‘The self and the cosmos experience nothing but happiness.’	mn102	14	14	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.15	‘The self and the cosmos experience nothing but suffering.’	mn102	14	15	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.16	‘The self and the cosmos experience both happiness and suffering.’	mn102	14	16	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:14.17	‘The self and the cosmos experience neither happiness nor suffering.’	mn102	14	17	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:15.1	Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows.	mn102	15	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:15.2	‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have personal knowledge of this that is pure and bright, apart from faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation.	mn102	15	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:15.3	But in the absence of personal knowledge that is pure and bright, even the portion of knowledge they illuminate is said to be grasping on their part.	mn102	15	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:15.4	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	15	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:15.5	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	15	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.1	Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows.	mn102	16	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.2	The self and the cosmos are not eternal,	mn102	16	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.3	or both eternal and not eternal,	mn102	16	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.4	or neither eternal nor not-eternal,	mn102	16	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.5	or finite,	mn102	16	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.6	or infinite,	mn102	16	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.7	or both finite and infinite,	mn102	16	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.8	or neither finite nor infinite,	mn102	16	8	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.9	or of unified perception,	mn102	16	9	mn	102	The Five and Three

mn102:16.14	or experience nothing but suffering,	mn102	16	14	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.15	or experience both happiness and suffering,	mn102	16	15	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.16	or experience neither happiness nor suffering. It’s simply not possible for them to have personal knowledge of this that is pure and bright, apart from faith, endorsement, oral transmission, reasoned train of thought, or acceptance of a view after deliberation.	mn102	16	16	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.17	But in the absence of personal knowledge that is pure and bright, even the portion of knowledge they illuminate is said to be grasping on their part.	mn102	16	17	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.18	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	16	18	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:16.19	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	16	19	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:17.1	Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, enter and remain in the rapture of seclusion:	mn102	17	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:17.2	‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in the rapture of seclusion.’	mn102	17	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:17.3	But that rapture of seclusion of theirs ceases.	mn102	17	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:17.4	When the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.	mn102	17	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.1	It’s like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves, or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leaves.	mn102	18	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.2	In the same way, when the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.	mn102	18	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.3	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	18	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.4	This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, enters and remains in the rapture of seclusion:	mn102	18	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.5	‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in the rapture of seclusion.’	mn102	18	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.6	But that rapture of seclusion of theirs ceases.	mn102	18	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:18.7	When the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.	mn102	18	7	mn	102	The Five and Three

mn102:18.9	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	18	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:19.1	Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion, enter and remain in pleasure not of the flesh.	mn102	19	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:19.2	‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in pleasure not of the flesh.’	mn102	19	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:19.3	But that pleasure not of the flesh of theirs ceases.	mn102	19	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:19.4	When pleasure not of the flesh ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises; and when the rapture of seclusion ceases, pleasure not of the flesh arises.	mn102	19	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:20.1	It’s like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves, or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leaves. …	mn102	20	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:20.3	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	20	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:20.4	This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion, enters and remains in pleasure not of the flesh.	mn102	20	4	mn	102	The Five and Three

mn102:20.9	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	20	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:21.1	Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion and pleasure not of the flesh, enter and remain in neutral feeling.	mn102	21	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:21.2	‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in neutral feeling.’	mn102	21	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:21.3	Then that neutral feeling ceases.	mn102	21	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:21.4	When neutral feeling ceases, pleasure not of the flesh arises; and when pleasure not of the flesh ceases, neutral feelings arises.	mn102	21	4	mn	102	The Five and Three

mn102:23.1	Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, go beyond the rapture of seclusion, pleasure not of the flesh, and neutral feeling.	mn102	23	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:23.2	They regard themselves like this: ‘I am at peace; I am quenched; I am free of grasping.’	mn102	23	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.1	The Realized One understands this as follows.	mn102	24	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.2	This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, not fixating on the fetters of sensuality, goes beyond the rapture of seclusion, pleasure not of the flesh, and neutral feeling.	mn102	24	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.3	They regard themselves like this: ‘I am at peace; I am quenched; I am free of grasping.’	mn102	24	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.4	Clearly this venerable speaks of a practice that’s conducive to extinguishment.	mn102	24	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.5	Nevertheless, they still grasp at theories about the past or the future, or the fetters of sensuality, or the rapture of seclusion, or pleasure not of the flesh, or neutral feeling.	mn102	24	5	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.6	And when they regard themselves like this:	mn102	24	6	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.7	‘I am at peace; I am quenched; I am free of grasping,’ that’s also said to be grasping on their part.	mn102	24	7	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.8	‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’	mn102	24	8	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:24.9	Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.	mn102	24	9	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:25.1	But the Realized One has awakened to the supreme state of sublime peace, that is,	mn102	25	1	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:25.2	liberation by not grasping after truly understanding the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.”	mn102	25	2	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:25.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn102	25	3	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn102:25.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn102	25	4	mn	102	The Five and Three
mn103:1.1	So I have heard.	mn103	1	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusinārā, in the Forest of Offerings.	mn103	1	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn103	1	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn103	1	4	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn103	1	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn103	1	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.1	“Mendicants, is this what you think of me?	mn103	2	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.2	‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’”	mn103	2	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.3	“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.”	mn103	2	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.5	“If you don’t think of me that way,	mn103	2	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.8	then what exactly do you think of me?”	mn103	2	8	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.9	“We think of you this way:	mn103	2	9	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.10	‘The Buddha is sympathetic and wants what’s best for us.	mn103	2	10	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.11	He teaches out of sympathy.’”	mn103	2	11	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.12	“So it seems you think	mn103	2	12	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:2.14	that I teach out of sympathy.	mn103	2	14	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:3.1	In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is:	mn103	3	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:3.2	the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. You should train in these things in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling.	mn103	3	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:4.1	As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching.	mn103	4	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:5.1	Now, you might think,	mn103	5	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:5.2	‘These two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:	mn103	5	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:5.3	‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.	mn103	5	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:5.4	But the venerables should know that this is how	mn103	5	4	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?

mn103:5.6	Please don’t get into a dispute about this.’	mn103	5	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?

mn103:5.8	‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.	mn103	5	8	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?

mn103:5.13	Remembering this, you should speak on the teaching and the training.	mn103	5	13	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?

mn103:9.1	As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, one of the mendicants might commit an offense or transgression.	mn103	9	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:10.1	In such a case, you should not be in a hurry to accuse them. The individual should be examined like this:	mn103	10	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:10.2	‘I won’t be troubled and the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and acrimonious. They don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily.

mn103:13.5	that I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’	mn103	13	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:13.6	If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.	mn103	13	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:14.1	But suppose you think this:	mn103	14	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:14.2	‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and acrimonious. And they hold fast to their views, refusing to let go. I cannot draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’	mn103	14	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:14.3	Don’t underestimate the value of equanimity regarding such a person.	mn103	14	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.1	As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, the sides might continue to bring up settled issues with each other, with contempt for each other’s views, resentful, bitter, and exasperated.	mn103	15	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.2	In this case you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable among those who side with one party and say to them:	mn103	15	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.3	‘Reverend, as we were training, the sides continued to bring up settled issues with each other. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he criticize it?’	mn103	15	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.4	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	mn103	15	4	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.5	‘Yes, reverend, he would.’	mn103	15	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.6	‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’	mn103	15	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.7	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	mn103	15	7	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:15.8	‘No, reverend, one cannot.’	mn103	15	8	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.1	Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:	mn103	16	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.2	‘Reverend, as we were training, the sides continued to bring up settled issues with each other. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he criticize it?’	mn103	16	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.3	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	mn103	16	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.4	‘Yes, reverend, he would.’	mn103	16	4	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.5	‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’	mn103	16	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.6	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	mn103	16	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:16.7	‘No, reverend, one cannot.’	mn103	16	7	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.1	If others should ask that mendicant:	mn103	17	1	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.2	‘Were you the venerable who drew those mendicants away from the unskillful and established them in the skillful?’	mn103	17	2	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.3	Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:	mn103	17	3	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.4	‘Well, reverends, I approached the Buddha. He taught me the Dhamma. After hearing that teaching I explained it to those mendicants.	mn103	17	4	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.5	When those mendicants heard that teaching they were drawn away from the unskillful and established in the skillful.’	mn103	17	5	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.6	Answering in this way, that mendicant doesn’t glorify themselves or put others down. They answer in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism.”	mn103	17	6	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.7	That is what the Buddha said.	mn103	17	7	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn103:17.8	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn103	17	8	mn	103	Is This What You Think Of Me?
mn104:1.1	So I have heard.	mn104	1	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the village of Sāma.	mn104	1	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:2.1	Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.	mn104	2	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:2.2	With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:	mn104	2	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:2.3	“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”	mn104	2	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:2.4	You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.	mn104	2	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:2.5	And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.	mn104	2	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:3.1	And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	mn104	3	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.1	Ānanda said to him,	mn104	4	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.2	“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.	mn104	4	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.3	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”	mn104	4	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.	mn104	4	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.5	Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and Ānanda informed him of what Cunda had said. He went on to say,	mn104	4	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.9	“Sir, it occurs to me:	mn104	4	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.10	‘When the Buddha has passed away, let no dispute arise in the Saṅgha.	mn104	4	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:4.11	For such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.’”	mn104	4	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.1	“What do you think, Ānanda?	mn104	5	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.2	Do you see even two mendicants whose opinion differs regarding the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is,	mn104	5	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.3	the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path?”	mn104	5	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.4	“No, sir, I do not.	mn104	5	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.6	Nevertheless, there are some individuals who appear to live obedient to the Buddha, but when the Buddha has passed away they might create a dispute in the Saṅgha regarding livelihood or the monastic code.	mn104	5	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.7	Such a dispute would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.”	mn104	5	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.8	“Ānanda, dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matter.	mn104	5	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:5.9	But should a dispute arise in the Saṅgha concerning the path or the practice, that would be for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	mn104	5	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.1	Ānanda, there are these six roots of arguments.	mn104	6	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.2	What six?	mn104	6	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.3	Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and acrimonious.	mn104	6	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.4	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.	mn104	6	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.5	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	mn104	6	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.6	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.	mn104	6	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.7	If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.	mn104	6	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:6.8	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.	mn104	6	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous …	mn104	7-11	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.2	They’re jealous and stingy …	mn104	7-11	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.3	They’re devious and deceitful …	mn104	7-11	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.4	They have corrupt wishes and wrong view …	mn104	7-11	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.5	They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.	mn104	7-11	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.6	Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.	mn104	7-11	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.7	They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the detriment and suffering of the people, against the people, for the harm, detriment, and suffering of gods and humans.	mn104	7-11	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.8	If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.	mn104	7-11	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.9	If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.	mn104	7-11	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.10	That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.	mn104	7-11	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:7-11.11	These are the six roots of arguments.	mn104	7-11	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:12.1	There are four kinds of disciplinary issues.	mn104	12	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:12.2	What four?	mn104	12	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:12.3	Disciplinary issues due to disputes, accusations, offenses, or business.	mn104	12	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:12.4	These are the four kinds of disciplinary issues.	mn104	12	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:13.1	There are seven methods for the settlement of any disciplinary issues that might arise.	mn104	13	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:13.2	Resolution face-to-face to be applied. Resolution through recollection to be granted. Resolution because of past insanity to be granted. Acting according to what has been admitted. Majority decision. Further penalty. Covering over as if with grass.	mn104	13	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.1	And how is there resolution face-to-face?	mn104	14	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.2	It’s when mendicants are disputing: ‘This is the teaching,’ ‘This is not the teaching,’ ‘This is the monastic law,’ ‘This is not the monastic law.’	mn104	14	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.3	Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony	mn104	14	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.4	and thoroughly go over the guidelines of the teaching.	mn104	14	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.5	They should settle that disciplinary issue in agreement with the guidelines.	mn104	14	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.6	That’s how there is resolution face-to-face.	mn104	14	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.7	And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	14	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:14.8	by resolution face-to-face.	mn104	14	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.1	And how is there majority decision?	mn104	15	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.2	If those mendicants are not able to settle that issue in that monastery,	mn104	15	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.3	they should go to another monastery with more mendicants.	mn104	15	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.4	There they should all sit together in harmony	mn104	15	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.5	and thoroughly go over the guidelines of the teaching.	mn104	15	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.6	They should settle that disciplinary issue in agreement with the guidelines.	mn104	15	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.7	That’s how there is majority decision. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	15	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:15.8	by majority decision.	mn104	15	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.1	And how is there resolution through recollection?	mn104	16	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.2	It’s when mendicants accuse a mendicant of a serious offense; one entailing expulsion, or close to it:	mn104	16	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	mn104	16	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.4	They say:	mn104	16	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.5	‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	mn104	16	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.6	The resolution through recollection should be granted to them.	mn104	16	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.7	That’s how there is the resolution through recollection. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	16	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:16.8	by resolution through recollection.	mn104	16	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.1	And how is there resolution because of past insanity?	mn104	17	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.2	It’s when a mendicant accuses a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:	mn104	17	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	mn104	17	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.4	They say:	mn104	17	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.5	‘No, reverend, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	mn104	17	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.6	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicant pursues the issue:	mn104	17	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.7	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	mn104	17	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.8	They say:	mn104	17	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.9	‘Reverend, I had gone mad, I was out of my mind.	mn104	17	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.10	And while I was mad I did and said many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	mn104	17	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.11	I don’t remember any of that,	mn104	17	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.12	I was mad when I did it.’	mn104	17	12	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.13	The resolution because of past insanity should be granted to them.	mn104	17	13	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.14	That’s how there is resolution because of past insanity. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	17	14	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:17.15	by resolution because of past insanity.	mn104	17	15	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.1	And how is there acting according to what has been admitted?	mn104	18	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.2	It’s when a mendicant, whether accused or not, recalls an offense and clarifies it and reveals it.	mn104	18	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.3	After approaching a more senior mendicant, that mendicant should arrange his robe over one shoulder, bow to that mendicant’s feet, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say:	mn104	18	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.4	‘Sir, I have fallen into such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’	mn104	18	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.5	The senior mendicant says:	mn104	18	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.6	‘Do you see it?’	mn104	18	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.7	‘Yes, I see it.’	mn104	18	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.8	‘Then restrain yourself in future.’	mn104	18	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.9	‘I shall restrain myself.’	mn104	18	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.10	That’s how there is acting according to what has been admitted. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	18	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:18.11	by acting according to what has been admitted.	mn104	18	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.1	And how is there a verdict of further penalty?	mn104	19	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.2	It’s when a mendicant accuses a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:	mn104	19	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.3	‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’	mn104	19	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.4	They say:	mn104	19	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.5	‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’	mn104	19	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.6	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:	mn104	19	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.7	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	mn104	19	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.8	They say:	mn104	19	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.9	‘Reverends, I don’t recall committing a serious offense of that nature.	mn104	19	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.10	But I do recall committing a light offense.’	mn104	19	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.11	But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:	mn104	19	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.12	‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	mn104	19	12	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.13	They say:	mn104	19	13	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.14	‘Reverends, I’ll go so far as to acknowledge this light offense even when not asked.	mn104	19	14	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.15	Why wouldn’t I acknowledge a serious offense when asked?’	mn104	19	15	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.16	They say:	mn104	19	16	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.17	‘You wouldn’t have acknowledged that light offense without being asked, so why would you acknowledge a serious offense?	mn104	19	17	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.18	Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’	mn104	19	18	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.19	They say:	mn104	19	19	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.20	‘Reverend, I do recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it.	mn104	19	20	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.21	I spoke too hastily when I said	mn104	19	21	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.22	that I didn’t recall it.’	mn104	19	22	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.23	That’s how there is further penalty. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	19	23	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:19.24	by further penalty.	mn104	19	24	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.1	And how is there the covering over as if with grass?	mn104	20	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.2	It’s when the mendicants continually argue, quarrel, and dispute, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	mn104	20	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.3	Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony.	mn104	20	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.4	A competent mendicant of one party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raised their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:	mn104	20	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.5	‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.	mn104	20	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.6	We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and disputing, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	mn104	20	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.7	If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over as if with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’	mn104	20	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.8	Then a competent mendicant of the other party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raising their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:	mn104	20	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.9	‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.	mn104	20	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.10	We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and disputing, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.	mn104	20	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.11	If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over as if with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’	mn104	20	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.12	That’s how there is the covering over as if with grass. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,	mn104	20	12	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:20.13	by covering over as if with grass.	mn104	20	13	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.1	Ānanda, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn104	21	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.2	What six?	mn104	21	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.3	Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private.	mn104	21	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.4	This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn104	21	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.5	Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness …	mn104	21	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.6	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	mn104	21	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.7	Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …	mn104	21	7	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.8	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	mn104	21	8	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.9	Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material things they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions.	mn104	21	9	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.10	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	mn104	21	10	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.11	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are intact, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.	mn104	21	11	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.12	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	mn104	21	12	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.13	Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and delivers one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.	mn104	21	13	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.14	This too is a warm-hearted quality.	mn104	21	14	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:21.15	These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.	mn104	21	15	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.1	If you should undertake and follow these six warm-hearted qualities, do you see any criticism, large or small, that you could not endure?”	mn104	22	1	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.2	“No, sir.”	mn104	22	2	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.3	“That’s why, Ānanda, you should undertake and follow these six warm-hearted qualities.	mn104	22	3	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.4	That will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.”	mn104	22	4	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn104	22	5	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn104:22.6	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn104	22	6	mn	104	At Sāmagāma
mn105:1.1	So I have heard.	mn105	1	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	mn105	1	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:2.1	Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence:	mn105	2	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:2.2	“We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”	mn105	2	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:2.3	Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this.	mn105	2	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:3.1	He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn105	3	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:4.1	“Sir, I have heard that	mn105	4	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:4.2	several mendicants have declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence.	mn105	4	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:4.5	I trust they did so rightly—or are there some who declared enlightenment out of overestimation?”	mn105	4	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.3	“Some of them did so rightly, Sunakkhatta, while others did so out of overestimation.	mn105	5	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.4	Now, when mendicants declare enlightenment rightly, that is their truth.	mn105	5	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.5	But when mendicants declare enlightenment out of overestimation, the Realized One thinks:	mn105	5	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.6	‘I should teach them the Dhamma.’	mn105	5	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.7	If the Realized One thinks	mn105	5	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.8	he should teach them the Dhamma,	mn105	5	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.9	but then certain futile men, having carefully planned a question, approach the Realized One and ask it,	mn105	5	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.10	then the Realized One	mn105	5	10	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:5.11	changes his mind.”	mn105	5	11	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:6.1	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	mn105	6	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:6.2	Let the Buddha teach the Dhamma. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn105	6	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:6.3	“Well then, Sunakkhatta, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn105	6	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:6.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Sunakkhatta.	mn105	6	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:6.5	The Buddha said this:	mn105	6	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.1	“Sunakkhatta, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn105	7	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.2	What five?	mn105	7	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn105	7	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.4	Sounds known by the ear …	mn105	7	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.5	Smells known by the nose …	mn105	7	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn105	7	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn105	7	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:7.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn105	7	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:8.1	It’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh.	mn105	8	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:8.2	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	8	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:8.3	But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	8	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.1	Suppose a person had left their own village or town long ago,	mn105	9	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.2	and they saw another person who had only recently left there.	mn105	9	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.3	They would ask about whether their village was safe, with plenty of food and little disease,	mn105	9	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.4	and the other person would tell them the news.	mn105	9	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.5	What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	mn105	9	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.6	Would that person want to listen to that other person? Would they actively listen and try to understand? Would they associate with that person, and find it satisfying?”	mn105	9	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.7	“Yes, sir.”	mn105	9	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.8	“In the same way, it’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh.	mn105	9	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.9	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	9	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.10	But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	9	10	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.11	You should know of them:	mn105	9	11	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:9.12	‘That individual is intent on pleasures of the flesh, for they’re detached from things connected with the imperturbable.’	mn105	9	12	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:10.1	It’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on the imperturbable.	mn105	10	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:10.2	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	10	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:10.3	But when talk connected with worldly pleasures of the flesh is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	10	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:11.1	Suppose there was a fallen, withered leaf. It’s incapable of becoming green again.	mn105	11	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:11.2	In the same way, an individual intent on the imperturbable has dropped the connection with worldly pleasures of the flesh.	mn105	11	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:11.3	You should know of them:	mn105	11	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:11.4	‘That individual is intent on the imperturbable, for they’re detached from things connected with pleasures of the flesh.’	mn105	11	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:12.1	It’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of nothingness.	mn105	12	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:12.2	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	12	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:12.3	But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	12	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:13.1	Suppose there was a broad rock that had been broken in half, so that it could not be put back together again.	mn105	13	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:13.2	In the same way, an individual intent on the dimension of nothingness has broken the connection with the imperturbable.	mn105	13	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:13.3	You should know of them:	mn105	13	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:13.4	‘That individual is intent on the dimension of nothingness, for they’re detached from things connected with the imperturbable.’	mn105	13	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:14.1	It’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn105	14	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:14.2	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	14	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:14.3	But when talk connected with the dimension of nothingness is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	14	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.1	Suppose someone had eaten some delectable food and thrown it up.	mn105	15	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.2	What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	mn105	15	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.3	Would that person want to eat that food again?”	mn105	15	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.4	“No, sir.	mn105	15	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.5	Why is that?	mn105	15	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.6	Because that food is deemed repulsive.”	mn105	15	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.7	“In the same way, an individual intent on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception has vomited the connection with the dimension of nothingness.	mn105	15	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.8	You should know of them:	mn105	15	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:15.9	‘That individual is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, for they’re detached from things connected with the dimension of nothingness.’	mn105	15	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:16.1	It’s possible that a certain individual may be rightly intent on extinguishment.	mn105	16	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:16.2	Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying.	mn105	16	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:16.3	But when talk connected with the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying.	mn105	16	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:17.1	Suppose there was a palm tree with its crown cut off. It’s incapable of further growth.	mn105	17	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:17.2	In the same way, an individual rightly intent on extinguishment has cut off the connection with the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.	mn105	17	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:17.3	You should know of them:	mn105	17	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:17.4	‘That individual is rightly intent on extinguishment, for they’re detached from things connected with the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’	mn105	17	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.1	It’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	mn105	18	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.2	‘The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart; and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will.	mn105	18	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.3	I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance; I am rightly intent on extinguishment.’	mn105	18	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.4	Having such conceit, though it’s not based in fact,	mn105	18	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.5	they would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment: unsuitable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	mn105	18	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.6	Doing so, lust infects their mind,	mn105	18	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:18.7	resulting in death or deadly pain.	mn105	18	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.1	Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.	mn105	19	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.2	Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.	mn105	19	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.3	The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,	mn105	19	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.4	probe for the arrow,	mn105	19	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.5	extract it, and expel the poison, leaving some residue behind.	mn105	19	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.6	Imagining that no residue remained, the surgeon would say:	mn105	19	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.7	‘My good man, the dart has been extracted and the poison expelled without residue.	mn105	19	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.8	It is still capable of harming you.	mn105	19	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.9	Eat only suitable food. Don’t eat unsuitable food, or else the wound may get infected.	mn105	19	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.10	Regularly wash the wound and anoint the opening, or else it’ll get covered with pus and blood.	mn105	19	10	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.11	Don’t walk too much in the wind and sun, or else dust and dirt will infect the wound.	mn105	19	11	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:19.12	Take care of the wound, my good fellow, heal it.’	mn105	19	12	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.1	They’d think:	mn105	20	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.2	‘The dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	mn105	20	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.3	It’s not capable of harming me.’	mn105	20	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.4	They’d eat unsuitable food, and the wound would get infected.	mn105	20	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.5	And they wouldn’t regularly wash and anoint the opening, so it would get covered in pus and blood.	mn105	20	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.6	And they’d walk too much in the wind and sun, so dust and dirt infected the wound.	mn105	20	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.7	And they wouldn’t take care of the wound or heal it.	mn105	20	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.8	Then both because they did what was unsuitable, and because of the residue of unclean poison, the wound would spread,	mn105	20	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:20.9	resulting in death or deadly pain.	mn105	20	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.1	In the same way, it’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	mn105	21	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.2	‘The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart; and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will.	mn105	21	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.3	I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance; I am rightly intent on extinguishment.’	mn105	21	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.4	Having such conceit, though it’s not based in fact,	mn105	21	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.5	they would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment: unsuitable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	mn105	21	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.6	Doing so, lust infects their mind,	mn105	21	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:21.7	resulting in death or deadly pain.	mn105	21	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:22.1	For it is death in the training of the Noble One to reject the training and return to a lesser life.	mn105	22	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:22.2	And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses.	mn105	22	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.1	It’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	mn105	23	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.2	‘The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart; and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will.	mn105	23	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.3	I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance; I am rightly intent on extinguishment.’	mn105	23	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.4	Being rightly intent on extinguishment, they wouldn’t engage in things unconducive to extinguishment: unsuitable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.	mn105	23	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.5	Doing so, lust wouldn’t infect their mind,	mn105	23	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:23.6	so no death or deadly pain would result.	mn105	23	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.1	Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.	mn105	24	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.2	Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a surgeon to treat them.	mn105	24	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.3	The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel,	mn105	24	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.4	probe for the arrow,	mn105	24	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.5	extract it, and expel the poison, leaving no residue behind.	mn105	24	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.6	Knowing that no residue remained, the surgeon would say:	mn105	24	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.7	‘My good man, the dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	mn105	24	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.8	It’s not capable of harming you.	mn105	24	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.9	Eat only suitable food. Don’t eat unsuitable food, or else the wound may get infected.	mn105	24	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.10	Regularly wash the wound and anoint the opening, or else it’ll get covered with pus and blood.	mn105	24	10	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.11	Don’t walk too much in the wind and sun, or else dust and dirt will infect the wound.	mn105	24	11	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:24.12	Take care of the wound, my good fellow, heal it.’	mn105	24	12	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.1	They’d think:	mn105	25	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.2	‘The dart has been extracted and the poison expelled with no residue.	mn105	25	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta

mn105:25.4	They’d eat suitable food, and the wound wouldn’t get infected.	mn105	25	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.5	And they’d regularly wash and anoint the opening, so it wouldn’t get covered in pus and blood.	mn105	25	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.6	And they wouldn’t walk too much in the wind and sun, so dust and dirt wouldn’t infect the wound.	mn105	25	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.7	And they’d take care of the wound and heal it.	mn105	25	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.8	Then both because they did what was suitable, and the unclean poison had left no residue, the wound would heal,	mn105	25	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:25.9	and no death or deadly pain would result.	mn105	25	9	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:26.1	In the same way, it’s possible that a certain mendicant might think:	mn105	26	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:26.2	‘The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart; and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will.	mn105	26	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta

mn105:27.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	mn105	27	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:27.2	And this is the point:	mn105	27	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:27.3	‘Wound’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.	mn105	27	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta

mn105:27.8	‘Surgeon’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn105	27	8	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:28.1	Truly, Sunakkhatta, that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact.	mn105	28	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:28.2	Understanding that attachment is the root of suffering, they are freed with the ending of attachments. It’s not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachment.	mn105	28	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.1	Suppose there was a bronze goblet of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor.	mn105	29	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.2	But it was mixed with poison.	mn105	29	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.3	Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	mn105	29	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.4	What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	mn105	29	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.5	Would that person drink that beverage if they knew that	mn105	29	5	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.6	it would result in death or deadly suffering?”	mn105	29	6	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:29.7	“No, sir.”	mn105	29	7	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta

mn105:30.1	Suppose there was a lethal viper.	mn105	30	1	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:30.2	Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.	mn105	30	2	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:30.3	What do you think, Sunakkhatta?	mn105	30	3	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:30.4	Would that person give that lethal viper their hand or finger if they knew that	mn105	30	4	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta

mn105:30.10	That is what the Buddha said.	mn105	30	10	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn105:30.11	Satisfied, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavi clan approved what the Buddha said.	mn105	30	11	mn	105	With Sunakkhatta
mn106:1.1	So I have heard.	mn106	1	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.	mn106	1	2	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn106	1	3	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn106	1	4	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn106	1	5	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn106	1	6	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:2.1	“Mendicants, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive.	mn106	2	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable

mn106:11.6	the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.	mn106	11	6	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.1	Take a mendicant who practices like this:	mn106	12	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.2	‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’	mn106	12	2	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.3	In this way they gain equanimity.	mn106	12	3	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.4	They don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to that equanimity.	mn106	12	4	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.5	So their consciousness doesn’t have that as support and fuel for grasping.	mn106	12	5	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:12.6	A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished.”	mn106	12	6	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	mn106	13	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.2	It seems the Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or another.	mn106	13	2	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.3	But sir, what is noble liberation?”	mn106	13	3	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.4	“Ānanda, it’s when a noble disciple reflects like this:	mn106	13	4	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.5	‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,	mn106	13	5	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.6	sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,	mn106	13	6	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.7	visions in this life and in lives to come,	mn106	13	7	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.8	perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,	mn106	13	8	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.9	perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the dimension of nothingness, perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;	mn106	13	9	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.10	that is substantial reality as far as substantial reality extends.	mn106	13	10	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:13.11	But this is freedom from death, namely the liberation of the mind through not grasping.	mn106	13	11	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:14.1	So, Ānanda, I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or another, and I have taught noble liberation.	mn106	14	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:15.1	Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.	mn106	15	1	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:15.2	Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”	mn106	15	2	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:15.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn106	15	3	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn106:15.4	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn106	15	4	mn	106	Conducive to the Imperturbable
mn107:1.1	So I have heard.	mn107	1	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	mn107	1	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:1.3	Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn107	1	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn107	1	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.1	“Worthy Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progress	mn107	2	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.2	down to the last step of the staircase.	mn107	2	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.3	Among the brahmins we can see gradual progress	mn107	2	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.4	in recitation.	mn107	2	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.5	Among archers we can see gradual progress	mn107	2	5	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.6	in archery.	mn107	2	6	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.7	Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see gradual progress	mn107	2	7	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.8	in mathematics.	mn107	2	8	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.9	For when we get an apprentice we first make them count:	mn107	2	9	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.10	‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’	mn107	2	10	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.11	We even make them count up to a hundred.	mn107	2	11	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:2.12	Is it possible to similarly describe a gradual training, gradual progress, and gradual practice in this teaching and training?”	mn107	2	12	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:3.1	“It is possible, brahmin.	mn107	3	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:3.2	Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.	mn107	3	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:3.3	In the same way, when the Realized One gets a person for training they first guide them like this:	mn107	3	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:3.4	‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’	mn107	3	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.1	When they have ethical conduct, the Realized One guides them further:	mn107	4	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.2	‘Come, mendicant, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn107	4	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.3	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve restraint over it.	mn107	4	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.4	When you hear a sound with your ears …	mn107	4	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.5	When you smell an odor with your nose …	mn107	4	5	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.6	When you taste a flavor with your tongue …	mn107	4	6	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.7	When you feel a touch with your body …	mn107	4	7	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.8	When you know an idea with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.	mn107	4	8	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:4.9	If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’	mn107	4	9	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:5.1	When they guard their sense doors, the Realized One guides them further:	mn107	5	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:5.2	‘Come, mendicant, eat in moderation.	mn107	5	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:5.3	Reflect rationally on the food that you eat:	mn107	5	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:5.4	‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’	mn107	5	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:6.1	When they eat in moderation, the Realized One guides them further:	mn107	6	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:6.2	‘Come, mendicant, be committed to wakefulness. Practice walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying your mind from obstacles. In the first watch of the night, continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle watch, lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying your mind from obstacles.’	mn107	6	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:7.1	When they are committed to wakefulness, the Realized One guides them further:	mn107	7	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:7.2	‘Come, mendicant, have mindfulness and situational awareness. Act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’	mn107	7	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:8.1	When they have mindfulness and situational awareness, the Realized One guides them further:	mn107	8	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:8.2	‘Come, mendicant, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.’	mn107	8	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.1	And they do so.	mn107	9	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.2	After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.	mn107	9	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.3	Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	mn107	9	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.4	Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.	mn107	9	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.5	Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.	mn107	9	5	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.6	Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	mn107	9	6	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:9.7	Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.	mn107	9	7	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:10.1	They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn107	10	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:10.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn107	10	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:10.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn107	10	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:10.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn107	10	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:10.5	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn107	10	5	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:11.1	That’s how I instruct the mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	mn107	11	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:11.2	But for those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—these things lead to blissful meditation in this life, and to mindfulness and awareness.”	mn107	11	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:12.1	When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha,	mn107	12	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:12.2	“When his disciples are instructed and advised like this by the worthy Gotama, do all of them achieve the ultimate goal, extinguishment, or do some of them fail?”	mn107	12	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:12.3	“Some succeed, while others fail.”	mn107	12	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:13.1	“What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why, though extinguishment is present, the path leading to extinguishment is present, and the worthy Gotama is present to encourage them,	mn107	13	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:13.2	still some succeed while others fail?”	mn107	13	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.1	“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn107	14	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.2	What do you think, brahmin?	mn107	14	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.3	Are you skilled in the road to Rājagaha?”	mn107	14	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.4	“Yes, I am.”	mn107	14	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.5	“What do you think, brahmin?	mn107	14	5	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.6	Suppose a person was to come along who wanted to go to Rājagaha.	mn107	14	6	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.7	He’d approach you and say:	mn107	14	7	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.8	‘Sir, I wish to go to Rājagaha.	mn107	14	8	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.9	Please point out the road to Rājagaha.’	mn107	14	9	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.10	You’d say to them:	mn107	14	10	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.11	‘Here, worthy man, this road goes to Rājagaha.	mn107	14	11	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.12	Go along it for an hour, and you’ll see a certain village. Go along an hour further, and you’ll see a certain town.	mn107	14	12	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.13	Go along an hour further and you’ll see Rājagaha with its delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.’	mn107	14	13	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.14	Instructed like this by you, they might still take the wrong road, heading west.	mn107	14	14	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.15	But a second person might come with the same question and receive the same instructions.	mn107	14	15	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.24	Instructed by you, they might safely arrive at Rājagaha.	mn107	14	24	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.25	What is the cause, brahmin, what is the reason why, though Rājagaha is present, the path leading to Rājagaha is present, and you are there to encourage them,	mn107	14	25	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.26	one person takes the wrong path and heads west, while another arrives safely at Rājagaha?”	mn107	14	26	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.27	“What can I do about that, worthy Gotama?	mn107	14	27	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.28	I am the one who shows the way.”	mn107	14	28	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.29	“In the same way, though extinguishment is present, the path leading to extinguishment is present, and I am present to encourage them,	mn107	14	29	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.30	still some of my disciples, instructed and advised like this, achieve the ultimate goal, extinguishment, while some of them fail.	mn107	14	30	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.31	What can I do about that, brahmin?	mn107	14	31	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:14.32	The Realized One is the one who shows the way.”	mn107	14	32	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:15.1	When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha,	mn107	15	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:15.2	“Worthy Gotama, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not committed to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and idiotic. the worthy Gotama does not live together with these.	mn107	15	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:15.3	But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are committed to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise and clever. the worthy Gotama does live together with these.	mn107	15	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:16.1	Of all kinds of fragrant root, spikenard is said to be the best.	mn107	16	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:16.2	Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best.	mn107	16	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:16.3	Of all kinds of fragrant flower, jasmine is said to be the best.	mn107	16	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:16.4	In the same way, worthy Gotama’s advice is the best of contemporary teachings.	mn107	16	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:17.1	Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn107	17	1	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:17.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	mn107	17	2	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:17.3	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn107	17	3	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn107:17.4	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	mn107	17	4	mn	107	With Moggallāna the Accountant
mn108:1.1	So I have heard.	mn108	1	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:1.2	At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully quenched.	mn108	1	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:2.1	Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, being suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rājagaha fortified.	mn108	2	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:3.1	Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	mn108	3	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:3.2	Then it occurred to him,	mn108	3	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:3.3	“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.	mn108	3	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:3.4	Why don’t I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of work?”	mn108	3	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.1	So that’s what he did.	mn108	4	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.2	Moggallāna the Guardian saw Ānanda coming off in the distance	mn108	4	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.3	and said to him,	mn108	4	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.4	“Come, worthy Ānanda!	mn108	4	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.5	Welcome, worthy Ānanda!	mn108	4	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.6	It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.	mn108	4	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.7	Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”	mn108	4	7	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.8	Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,	mn108	4	8	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.9	while Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one side.	mn108	4	9	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:4.10	Then he said to Ānanda,	mn108	4	10	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:5.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by the worthy Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	mn108	5	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:5.2	“No, brahmin, there is not.	mn108	5	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:5.3	For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.	mn108	5	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:5.4	And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.”	mn108	5	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:6.1	But this conversation between Ānanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinished.	mn108	6	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:6.2	For just then the brahmin Vassakāra, a minister of Magadha, while supervising the work at Rājagaha, approached Ānanda at Moggallāna’s place of work and exchanged greetings with him.	mn108	6	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:6.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,	mn108	6	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:6.4	“Worthy Ānanda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn108	6	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:6.5	So Ānanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived. Vassakāra said:	mn108	6	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:7.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by the worthy Gotama, saying:	mn108	7	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:7.2	‘This one will be your refuge when I have passed away,’ to whom you would now turn?”	mn108	7	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:7.3	“No, there is not.”	mn108	7	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:8.1	“But is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants?”	mn108	8	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:8.3	“No, there is not.”	mn108	8	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:9.1	“But since you lack a refuge, worthy Ānanda, what’s the reason for your harmony?”	mn108	9	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:9.2	“We don’t lack a refuge, brahmin,	mn108	9	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:9.3	we have a refuge.	mn108	9	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:9.4	The teaching is our refuge.”	mn108	9	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.1	“But worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,	mn108	10	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.5	or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants—	mn108	10	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.6	who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,	mn108	10	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.7	you replied, ‘No, there is not.’	mn108	10	7	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.10	But you say that the reason for your harmony is that you have	mn108	10	10	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.12	the teaching as a refuge.	mn108	10	12	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.13	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn108	10	13	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.14	“The Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicants.	mn108	10	14	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.15	On the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as one.	mn108	10	15	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.16	We invite one who transmits the code to recite it.	mn108	10	16	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.17	If anyone remembers an offense or transgression while they’re reciting, we make them act in line with the teachings and in line with the instructions.	mn108	10	17	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.18	It’s not the good fellows who make us act,	mn108	10	18	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:10.19	it’s the teaching that makes us act.”	mn108	10	19	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:11.1	“Worthy Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on?”	mn108	11	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:11.2	“There is not, brahmin.”	mn108	11	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:11.3	“Worthy Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,	mn108	11	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.2	or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants—	mn108	12	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.3	who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,	mn108	12	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.4	you replied, ‘No, there is not.’	mn108	12	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.6	And when asked whether there is even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on,	mn108	12	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.7	you replied, ‘There is not.’	mn108	12	7	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:12.8	How should I see the meaning of this statement?”	mn108	12	8	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:13.1	“There are ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn108	13	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:13.2	We honor anyone in whom these things are found.	mn108	13	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:13.3	What ten?	mn108	13	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:14.1	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	mn108	14	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:15.1	They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.	mn108	15	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:15.2	These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	mn108	15	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:16.1	They’re content with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	mn108	16	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:17.1	They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in this life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	mn108	17	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:18.1	They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the realm of divinity.	mn108	18	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:19.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.	mn108	19	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.1	They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.	mn108	20	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.2	They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,	mn108	20	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.3	and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.	mn108	20	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.4	They understand mind with hate …	mn108	20	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.5	mind without hate …	mn108	20	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian

mn108:20.11	unexpansive mind …	mn108	20	11	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.12	mind that is not supreme …	mn108	20	12	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.13	mind that is supreme …	mn108	20	13	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian

mn108:20.16	freed mind …	mn108	20	16	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:20.17	They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.	mn108	20	17	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:21.1	They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	mn108	21	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:22.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	mn108	22	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:23.1	They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	mn108	23	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:23.2	These are the ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn108	23	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:23.3	We honor anyone in whom these things are found, and rely on them.”	mn108	23	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.1	When he had spoken, Vassakāra addressed General Upananda,	mn108	24	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.2	“What do you think, general?	mn108	24	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.3	Do these venerables honor, respect, revere, and venerate those who are worthy?”	mn108	24	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.4	“Indeed they do.	mn108	24	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.5	For if these venerables were not to honor, respect, revere, and venerate them,	mn108	24	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:24.6	then who exactly would they honor?”	mn108	24	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.1	Then Vassakāra said to Ānanda,	mn108	25	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.2	“Where are you staying at present?”	mn108	25	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.3	“In the Bamboo Grove, brahmin.”	mn108	25	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.4	“I hope the Bamboo Grove is delightful, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat?”	mn108	25	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.5	“Indeed it is, brahmin. And it is like that owing to such protectors and guardians as yourself.”	mn108	25	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.6	“Surely, worthy Ānanda, it is owing to the good fellows who meditate, making a habit of meditating.	mn108	25	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.7	For the good fellows do in fact meditate and make a habit of meditating.	mn108	25	7	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.8	This one time, worthy Ānanda, worthy Gotama was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	mn108	25	8	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.9	So I went there to see him.	mn108	25	9	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.10	And there he spoke about meditation in many ways.	mn108	25	10	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.11	He meditated, and made a habit of meditating.	mn108	25	11	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:25.12	And he praised all kinds of meditation.”	mn108	25	12	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.1	“No, brahmin, the Buddha did not praise all kinds of meditation, nor did he dispraise all kinds of meditation.	mn108	26	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.2	And what kind of meditation did he not praise?	mn108	26	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.3	It’s when someone’s heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.	mn108	26	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.4	Hiding sensual desire within, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.	mn108	26	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.5	Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will …	mn108	26	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.7	dullness and drowsiness …	mn108	26	7	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.9	restlessness and remorse …	mn108	26	9	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.11	doubt, and they don’t truly know and see the escape from doubt that has arisen.	mn108	26	11	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.12	Hiding doubt within, they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.	mn108	26	12	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:26.13	The Buddha didn’t praise this kind of meditation.	mn108	26	13	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.1	And what kind of meditation did he praise?	mn108	27	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.2	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn108	27	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn108	27	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.4	And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn108	27	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.5	Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn108	27	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:27.6	The Buddha praised this kind of meditation.”	mn108	27	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:28.1	“Well, worthy Ānanda, it seems that worthy Gotama criticized the kind of meditation that deserves criticism and praised that deserving of praise.	mn108	28	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:28.2	Well, now, worthy Ānanda, I must go.	mn108	28	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:28.3	I have many duties, and much to do.”	mn108	28	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:28.4	“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”	mn108	28	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:28.5	Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what Venerable Ānanda said, got up from his seat and left.	mn108	28	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.1	Soon after he had left, Moggallāna the Guardian said to Ānanda,	mn108	29	1	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.2	“Worthy Ānanda, you still haven’t answered my question.”	mn108	29	2	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.3	“But brahmin, didn’t I say:	mn108	29	3	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.4	‘There is no single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by the worthy Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	mn108	29	4	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.5	For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.	mn108	29	5	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn108:29.6	And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.’”	mn108	29	6	mn	108	With Moggallāna the Guardian
mn109:1.1	So I have heard.	mn109	1	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	mn109	1	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:2.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	mn109	2	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:3.1	Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	mn109	3	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:3.2	“I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”	mn109	3	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:3.3	“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”	mn109	3	3	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:3.4	That mendicant took his seat and said to the Buddha:	mn109	3	4	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:4.1	“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates:	mn109	4	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:4.2	form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”	mn109	4	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:4.3	“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.	mn109	4	3	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:4.5	Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:	mn109	4	5	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:5.1	“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”	mn109	5	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:5.2	“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.”	mn109	5	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:6.1	“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”	mn109	6	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:6.2	“Neither.	mn109	6	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:6.3	The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”	mn109	6	3	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:7.1	“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”	mn109	7	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:7.2	“There can,” said the Buddha.	mn109	7	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:7.3	“It’s when someone thinks:	mn109	7	3	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:7.4	‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’	mn109	7	4	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:7.5	That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”	mn109	7	5	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:8.1	“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”	mn109	8	1	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:8.2	“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.	mn109	8	2	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
mn109:8.3	Any kind of feeling at all …	mn109	8	3	mn	109	The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night

mn112:15.2	If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, I practiced restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.	mn112	15	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn112:15.9	When I had this noble sense restraint, I experienced an unsullied bliss inside myself.	mn112	15	9	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn112:16.2	When I had this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,	mn112	16	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:16.3	I frequented a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn112	16	3	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:16.4	After the meal, I returned from almsround, sat down cross-legged, set my body straight, and established mindfulness in his presence.	mn112	16	4	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:17.1	Giving up covetousness for the world, I meditated with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.	mn112	17	1	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn112:17.4	Giving up restlessness and remorse, I meditated without restlessness, my mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.	mn112	17	4	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn112:18.1	I gave up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.	mn112	18	1	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:18.2	Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn112	18	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:18.3	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …	mn112	18	3	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn112:18.5	fourth absorption.	mn112	18	5	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:19.1	When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.	mn112	19	1	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:19.2	I truly understood: “This is suffering” … “This is the origin of suffering” … “This is the cessation of suffering” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering”.	mn112	19	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:19.3	I truly understood: “These are defilements”… “This is the origin of defilements” … “This is the cessation of defilements” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements”.	mn112	19	3	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:20.1	Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.	mn112	20	1	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:20.2	When it was freed, I knew it was freed.	mn112	20	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:20.3	I understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	mn112	20	3	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:20.4	That is how I know and see so that I have eradicated I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.’	mn112	20	4	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:21.1	Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,	mn112	21	1	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification
mn112:21.2	and then say to them:	mn112	21	2	mn	112	The Sixfold Purification

mn115:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn115	1	5	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn115	1	6	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.1	“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	1	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.2	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	2	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.3	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	3	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.4	It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered.	mn115	2	4	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.5	In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	5	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.6	Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	6	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.7	Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.	mn115	2	7	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.8	So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe.	mn115	2	8	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.9	The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not.	mn115	2	9	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.10	The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not.	mn115	2	10	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.11	There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute.	mn115	2	11	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:2.12	So you should train like this: ‘We shall be astute, we shall be inquirers.’”	mn115	2	12	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	mn115	3	1	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:3.2	“Sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’?”	mn115	3	2	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:3.3	“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant is skilled in the elements, in the sense fields, in dependent origination, and in the possible and the impossible.	mn115	3	3	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:3.4	That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’.”	mn115	3	4	mn	115	Many Elements
mn115:4.1	“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”	mn115	4	1	mn	115	Many Elements

mn117:1.1	So I have heard.	mn117	1	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn117	1	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn117	1	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn117	1	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn117	1	5	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn117	1	6	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:2.1	“Mendicants, I will teach you noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites.	mn117	2	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn117	2	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn117	2	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:2.4	The Buddha said this:	mn117	2	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:3.1	“And what is noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites?	mn117	3	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:3.2	They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.	mn117	3	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:3.3	Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites	mn117	3	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:3.4	is what is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and also ‘with its prerequisites’.	mn117	3	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:4.1	In this context, right view comes first.	mn117	4	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:4.2	And how does right view come first?	mn117	4	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:4.3	When you understand wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view, that’s your right view.	mn117	4	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:5.1	And what is wrong view?	mn117	5	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:5.2	‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	mn117	5	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:5.3	This is wrong view.	mn117	5	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:6.1	And what is right view?	mn117	6	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:6.2	Right view is twofold, I say.	mn117	6	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:6.3	There is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.	mn117	6	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:6.4	And there is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.	mn117	6	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:7.1	And what is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?	mn117	7	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:7.2	‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’	mn117	7	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:7.3	This is right view that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.	mn117	7	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:8.1	And what is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?	mn117	8	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:8.2	It’s the wisdom—the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of principles, and right view as a factor of the path—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.	mn117	8	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:8.3	This is called right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.	mn117	8	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:9.1	They make an effort to give up wrong view and embrace right view: that’s their right effort.	mn117	9	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:9.2	Mindfully they give up wrong view and take up right view: that’s their right mindfulness.	mn117	9	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:9.3	So these three things keep running and circling around right view, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.	mn117	9	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:10.1	In this context, right view comes first.	mn117	10	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:10.2	And how does right view come first?	mn117	10	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:10.3	When you understand wrong thought as wrong thought and right thought as right thought, that’s your right view.	mn117	10	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:11.1	And what is wrong thought?	mn117	11	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:11.2	Thoughts of sensuality, of malice, and of cruelty.	mn117	11	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:11.3	This is wrong thought.	mn117	11	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:12.1	And what is right thought?	mn117	12	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:12.2	Right thought is twofold, I say.	mn117	12	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:12.3	There is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments.	mn117	12	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:12.4	And there is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.	mn117	12	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:13.1	And what is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds, and ripens in attachments?	mn117	13	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:13.2	Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.	mn117	13	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:13.3	This is right thought that is accompanied by defilements.	mn117	13	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:14.1	And what is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?	mn117	14	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:14.2	It’s the thinking—the placing of the mind, thought, planting, implanting, embedding of the mind, verbal process—in one intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.	mn117	14	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:14.3	This is right thought that is noble.	mn117	14	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:15.1	They make an effort to give up wrong thought and embrace right thought: that’s their right effort.	mn117	15	1	mn	117	The Great Forty

mn117:16.2	And how does right view come first?	mn117	16	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:16.3	When you understand wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech, that’s your right view.	mn117	16	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:17.1	And what is wrong speech?	mn117	17	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:17.2	Speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.	mn117	17	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:17.3	This is wrong speech.	mn117	17	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:18.1	And what is right speech?	mn117	18	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:18.2	Right speech is twofold, I say.	mn117	18	2	mn	117	The Great Forty

mn117:31.2	It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood.	mn117	31	2	mn	117	The Great Forty

mn117:36.2	This exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty has been rolled forth. And it cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world.	mn117	36	2	mn	117	The Great Forty

mn117:38.1	Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who adhered to the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that the Great Forty should be criticized or rejected.	mn117	38	1	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:38.2	Why is that?	mn117	38	2	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:38.3	For fear of blame, attack, and condemnation.”	mn117	38	3	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:38.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn117	38	4	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn117:38.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn117	38	5	mn	117	The Great Forty
mn118:1.1	So I have heard.	mn118	1	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as	mn118	1	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:1.3	the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others.	mn118	1	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:2.1	Now at that time the senior mendicants were advising and instructing the junior mendicants.	mn118	2	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:2.2	Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty.	mn118	2	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:2.3	Being instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before.	mn118	2	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:3.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish.	mn118	3	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:3.2	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:	mn118	3	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:4.1	“I am satisfied, mendicants, with this practice.	mn118	4	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:4.2	My heart is satisfied with this practice.	mn118	4	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:4.3	So you should rouse up even more energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.	mn118	4	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:4.4	I will wait here in Sāvatthī for the Komudī full moon of the fourth month.”	mn118	4	4	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:5.1	Mendicants from around the country heard about this,	mn118	5	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:5.3	and came down to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	mn118	5	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:6.1	And those senior mendicants instructed the junior mendicants even more.	mn118	6	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:6.2	Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants, while some instructed twenty, thirty, or forty.	mn118	6	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:6.3	Being instructed by the senior mendicants, the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before.	mn118	6	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:7.1	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by a Saṅgha of monks.	mn118	7	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:7.2	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:	mn118	7	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:8.1	“This assembly has no chaff, mendicants, it is free of chaff, pure, and consolidated in the core.	mn118	8	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:8.4	Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!	mn118	8	4	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:8.8	Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly!	mn118	8	8	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:9.1	For in this Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.	mn118	9	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:16.1	And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?	mn118	16	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:17.1	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	mn118	17	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:24.1	Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily,	mn118	24	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.2	or lightly,	mn118	24	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.3	or experiencing the whole body,	mn118	24	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.4	or stilling physical processes—	mn118	24	4	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.5	at that time they’re meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	24	5	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.6	For I say that the in-breaths and out-breaths are an aspect of the body.	mn118	24	6	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:24.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	24	7	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:25.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing rapture,	mn118	25	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:25.5	at that time they meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	25	5	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:25.6	For I say that careful application of mind to the in-breaths and out-breaths is an aspect of feelings.	mn118	25	6	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:25.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	25	7	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:26.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing the mind,	mn118	26	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:26.6	There is no development of mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say.	mn118	26	6	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:26.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	26	7	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:27.1	Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while observing impermanence,	mn118	27	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:27.4	or observing letting go—	mn118	27	4	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:27.5	at that time they meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	27	5	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:27.6	Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and displeasure, they watch over closely with equanimity.	mn118	27	6	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:27.7	That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.	mn118	27	7	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:28.1	That’s how mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.	mn118	28	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:29.1	And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors?	mn118	29	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:30.1	Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body, at that time their mindfulness is established and lucid.	mn118	30	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:30.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	30	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:31.1	As they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom.	mn118	31	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:31.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	31	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:32.1	As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging.	mn118	32	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:32.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	32	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:33.1	When they’re energetic, rapture not of the flesh arises.	mn118	33	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:33.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	33	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:34.1	When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil.	mn118	34	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:34.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	34	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:35.1	When the body is tranquil and they feel bliss, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn118	35	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:35.2	At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it.	mn118	35	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:40.1	That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors.	mn118	40	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:41.1	And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom?	mn118	41	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:42.1	It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,	mn118	42	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:42.2	investigation of principles,	mn118	42	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing

mn118:43.1	That’s how the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom.”	mn118	43	1	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:43.2	That is what the Buddha said.	mn118	43	2	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn118:43.3	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn118	43	3	mn	118	Mindfulness of Breathing
mn119:1.1	So I have heard.	mn119	1	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn119	1	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.1	Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them.	mn119	2	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.2	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing,	mn119	2	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.3	how the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.”	mn119	2	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.4	But their conversation was left unfinished. Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat on the seat spread out	mn119	2	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.5	and addressed the mendicants,	mn119	2	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.6	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn119	2	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:2.7	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said:	mn119	2	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:3.1	“And how, mendicants, is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?	mn119	3	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.1	It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.	mn119	4	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.2	Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.	mn119	4	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.3	Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’	mn119	4	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.4	When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’	mn119	4	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.5	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’	mn119	4	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.6	They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’	mn119	4	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.7	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	4	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.8	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	4	8	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:4.9	That’s how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	4	9	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:5.1	Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know ‘I am walking’. When standing they know ‘I am standing’. When sitting they know ‘I am sitting’. And when lying down they know ‘I am lying down’.	mn119	5	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:5.2	Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.	mn119	5	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:5.3	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	5	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:5.4	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	5	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:5.5	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	5	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:6.1	Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.	mn119	6	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:6.2	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	6	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:6.3	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	6	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:6.4	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	6	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.	mn119	7	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.2	‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’	mn119	7	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.3	It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as	mn119	7	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.4	fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice.	mn119	7	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.5	And someone with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents:	mn119	7	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.6	‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’	mn119	7	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.7	In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. …	mn119	7	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.9	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	7	9	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.10	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	7	10	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:7.11	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	7	11	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.1	Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:	mn119	8	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.2	‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’	mn119	8	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.3	It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops.	mn119	8	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.4	In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:	mn119	8	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.5	‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’	mn119	8	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.6	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	8	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.7	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	8	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:8.8	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	8	8	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.1	Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.	mn119	9	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.2	They’d compare it with their own body:	mn119	9	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	mn119	9	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.4	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	9	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.5	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	9	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:9.6	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	9	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:10.1	Or suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.	mn119	10	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:10.2	They’d compare it with their own body:	mn119	10	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:10.3	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	mn119	10	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:10.5	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	10	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:11-14.1	Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …	mn119	11-14	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:11-14.2	A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …	mn119	11-14	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:11-14.3	A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …	mn119	11-14	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:11-14.4	Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here an ankle bone, there a shin-bone, here a thigh-bone, there a hip-bone, here a rib-bone, there a back-bone, here an arm-bone, there a neck-bone, here a jaw-bone, there a tooth, here the skull. …	mn119	11-14	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.2	White bones, the color of shells …	mn119	15-17	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.3	Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …	mn119	15-17	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.4	Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.	mn119	15-17	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.5	They’d compare it with their own body:	mn119	15-17	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.6	‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’	mn119	15-17	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.7	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to lay life are given up.	mn119	15-17	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.8	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	15-17	8	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:15-17.9	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	15-17	9	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn119	18	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn119	18	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.3	It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.	mn119	18	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.4	In the same way, they drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.	mn119	18	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.5	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to lay life are given up.	mn119	18	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.6	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	18	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:18.7	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	18	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:19.1	Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn119	19	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:19.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn119	19	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:19.3	It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.	mn119	19	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:19.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.	mn119	19	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:19.6	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	19	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:20.1	Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’	mn119	20	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:20.2	They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn119	20	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:20.3	It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.	mn119	20	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:20.4	In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.	mn119	20	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:20.6	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	20	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.1	Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.	mn119	21	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.2	They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not filled with pure bright mind.	mn119	21	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.3	It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.	mn119	21	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.4	In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not filled with pure bright mind.	mn119	21	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.5	As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up.	mn119	21	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.6	Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi.	mn119	21	6	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:21.7	That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.	mn119	21	7	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:22.1	Anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization.	mn119	22	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:22.2	Anyone who brings into their mind the great ocean includes all of the streams that run down into it.	mn119	22	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:22.3	In the same way, anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization.	mn119	22	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:23.1	When a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.	mn119	23	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:23.2	Suppose a person were to throw a heavy stone ball at a mound of wet clay.	mn119	23	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:23.3	What do you think, mendicants?	mn119	23	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:23.4	Would that heavy stone ball find an entry into that mound of wet clay?”	mn119	23	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:23.5	“Yes, sir.”	mn119	23	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body

mn119:24.1	Suppose there was a dried up, withered log.	mn119	24	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:24.2	Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking	mn119	24	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:24.3	to light a fire and produce heat.	mn119	24	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:24.4	What do you think, mendicants?	mn119	24	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:24.5	By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log, could they light a fire and produce heat?”	mn119	24	5	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body

mn119:25.1	Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand, empty and hollow.	mn119	25	1	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:25.2	Then a person comes along with a load of water.	mn119	25	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:25.3	What do you think, mendicants?	mn119	25	3	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body
mn119:25.4	Could that person pour water into the jar?”	mn119	25	4	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body

mn119:26.2	Suppose a person were to throw a light ball of string at a door-panel made entirely of hardwood.	mn119	26	2	mn	119	Mindfulness of the Body

mn120:37.8	And, mendicants, that mendicant is not reborn anywhere.”	mn120	37	8	mn	120	Rebirth by Choice
mn120:37.9	That is what the Buddha said.	mn120	37	9	mn	120	Rebirth by Choice

mn121:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	mn121	1	2	mn	121	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness
mn121:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	mn121	2	1	mn	121	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness
mn121:3.1	“Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville.	mn121	3	1	mn	121	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness
mn121:3.2	There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	mn121	3	2	mn	121	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness
mn121:3.3	‘Ānanda, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’	mn121	3	3	mn	121	The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	mn122	1	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.	mn122	2	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.2	He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the lodge of the Sakyan Khemaka the Dark for the day’s meditation.	mn122	2	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.3	Now at that time many resting places had been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark.	mn122	2	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.4	The Buddha saw this,	mn122	2	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.5	and wondered,	mn122	2	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.6	“Many resting places have been spread out;	mn122	2	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:2.9	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ghaṭā’s lodge, where he sat on the seat spread out	mn122	2	9	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.10	and said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn122	2	10	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.11	“Many resting places have been spread out at the lodge of Khemaka the Dark;	mn122	2	11	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.12	are many mendicants living there?”	mn122	2	12	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.14	“Indeed there are, sir.	mn122	2	14	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:2.15	It’s currently the time for making robes.”	mn122	2	15	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:3.1	“Ānanda, a mendicant doesn’t shine who enjoys company and groups, who loves them and likes to enjoy them.	mn122	3	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:3.2	It is quite impossible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty.	mn122	3	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:3.3	But you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group, will get the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is possible.	mn122	3	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:4.1	Indeed, Ānanda, it is quite impossible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.	mn122	4	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:4.2	But it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone, withdrawn from the group will enter and remain in the freedom of heart—either that which is temporary and pleasant, or that which is irreversible and unshakable.	mn122	4	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:5.1	Ānanda, I do not see even a single sight which, with its decay and perishing, would not give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in someone who has desire and lust for it.	mn122	5	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:6.1	But this meditation has been understood by the Realized One, namely	mn122	6	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:6.2	to enter and remain in emptiness internally by not focusing on any signs.	mn122	6	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:6.3	Now, suppose that while the Realized One is practicing this meditation, monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their chief ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit him.	mn122	6	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:6.4	In that case, with a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, having totally eliminated defiling influences, he invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal.	mn122	6	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:7.1	Therefore, if a mendicant should wish,	mn122	7	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:7.2	‘May I enter and remain in emptiness internally!’ then they should still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally.	mn122	7	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:7.3	And how does a mendicant still, settle, unify, and immerse their mind in samādhi internally?	mn122	7	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:8.1	It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …	mn122	8	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:9.1	They focus on emptiness internally,	mn122	9	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:9.2	but their mind does not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.	mn122	9	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:12.2	‘I will not engage in the kind of speech that is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless.

mn122:13.5	In this way they are aware of the situation.	mn122	13	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.1	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn122	14	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.2	What five?	mn122	14	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.3	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn122	14	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.4	Sounds known by the ear …	mn122	14	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.5	Smells known by the nose …	mn122	14	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.6	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn122	14	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.7	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn122	14	7	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:14.8	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn122	14	8	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.1	So a mendicant should regularly check their own mind:	mn122	15	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.2	‘Does my mind take an interest in any of these five kinds of sensual stimulation?’	mn122	15	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.3	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows this:	mn122	15	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.4	‘My mind does take an interest.’	mn122	15	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.5	In that case, they understand:	mn122	15	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.6	‘I have not given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.’	mn122	15	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.7	In this way they are aware of the situation.	mn122	15	7	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.8	But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows this:	mn122	15	8	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.9	‘My mind does not take an interest.’	mn122	15	9	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.10	In that case, they understand:	mn122	15	10	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.11	‘I have given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.’	mn122	15	11	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:15.12	In this way they are aware of the situation.	mn122	15	12	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.1	A mendicant should meditate observing rise and fall in these five grasping aggregates:	mn122	16	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.2	‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.	mn122	16	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.3	Such is feeling …	mn122	16	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.4	Such is perception …	mn122	16	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.5	Such are choices …	mn122	16	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:16.6	Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’	mn122	16	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:17.1	As they do so, they give up the conceit ‘I am’ regarding the five grasping aggregates.	mn122	17	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:17.2	In that case, they understand:	mn122	17	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:17.3	‘I have given up the conceit “I am” regarding the five grasping aggregates.’	mn122	17	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:17.4	In this way they are aware of the situation.	mn122	17	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:18.1	These principles are entirely skillful, with skillful outcomes; they are noble, transcendent, and inaccessible to the Wicked One.	mn122	18	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:19.1	What do you think, Ānanda?	mn122	19	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:19.2	For what reason would a disciple deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher, even if sent away?”	mn122	19	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:19.3	“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn122	19	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:20.1	“A disciple would not deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher for the sake of this, namely statements, mixed prose & verse, or discussions.	mn122	20	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:20.2	Why is that?	mn122	20	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:20.3	Because for a long time you have learned the teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.	mn122	20	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:20.4	But a disciple would deem it worthwhile to follow the Teacher, even if sent away, for the sake of talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.	mn122	20	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:21.1	This being so, Ānanda, there is a peril for the tutor, a peril for the pupil, and a peril for a spiritual practitioner.	mn122	21	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.1	And how is there a peril for the tutor?	mn122	22	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.2	It’s when some teacher frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn122	22	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.3	While meditating withdrawn, they’re visited by a stream of brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.	mn122	22	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.4	When this happens, they enjoy infatuation, fall into greed, and return to indulgence.	mn122	22	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.5	This is said to be the tutor’s peril.	mn122	22	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.6	They’re ruined by bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn122	22	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:22.7	That’s how there is a peril for the tutor.	mn122	22	7	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:23.1	And how is there a peril for the pupil?	mn122	23	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:23.2	It’s when the disciple of a teacher, emulating their teacher’s fostering of seclusion,	mn122	23	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:23.3	frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn122	23	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:23.6	This is said to be the pupil’s peril.	mn122	23	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:23.7	They’re ruined by bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn122	23	7	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:23.8	That’s how there is a peril for the pupil.	mn122	23	8	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.1	And how is there a peril for a spiritual practitioner?	mn122	24	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.2	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	mn122	24	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.3	He frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn122	24	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:24.5	When this happens, he doesn’t enjoy infatuation, fall into greed, and return to indulgence.	mn122	24	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.6	But a disciple of this teacher, emulating their teacher’s fostering of seclusion,	mn122	24	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.7	frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.	mn122	24	7	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:24.9	When this happens, they enjoy infatuation, fall into greed, and return to indulgence.	mn122	24	9	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.10	This is said to be the spiritual practitioner’s peril.	mn122	24	10	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.11	They’re ruined by bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.	mn122	24	11	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.12	That’s how there is a peril for the spiritual practitioner.	mn122	24	12	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:24.13	And in this context, Ānanda, as compared to the peril of the tutor or the pupil, the peril of the spiritual practitioner has more painful, bitter results, and even leads to the underworld.	mn122	24	13	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:25.1	So, Ānanda, treat me as a friend, not as an enemy.	mn122	25	1	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:25.2	That will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.	mn122	25	2	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:25.3	And how do disciples treat their Teacher as an enemy, not a friend?	mn122	25	3	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:25.4	It’s when the Teacher teaches Dhamma to his disciples out of kindness and sympathy:	mn122	25	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:25.5	‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’	mn122	25	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness

mn122:27.4	The core will stand the test.”	mn122	27	4	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:27.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn122	27	5	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn122:27.6	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn122	27	6	mn	122	The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
mn123:1.1	So I have heard.	mn123	1	1	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn123	1	2	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.1	Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:	mn123	2	1	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.2	“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	mn123	2	2	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.3	For he is able to know the Buddhas of the past who have become completely quenched, cut off proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and transcended all suffering.	mn123	2	3	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.4	He knows their birth, names, clans, conduct, teaching, wisdom, meditation, and freedom.”	mn123	2	4	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.5	When they said this, Venerable Ānanda said,	mn123	2	5	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.6	“The Realized Ones are incredible, reverends, and they have incredible qualities.	mn123	2	6	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.7	They’re amazing, and they have amazing qualities.”	mn123	2	7	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.8	But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	mn123	2	8	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.9	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,	mn123	2	9	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.10	and addressed the mendicants:	mn123	2	10	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.11	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	mn123	2	11	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.12	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,	mn123	2	12	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:2.19	“Well then, Ānanda, say some more about the incredible and amazing qualities of the Realized One.”	mn123	2	19	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing
mn123:3.1	“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:	mn123	3	1	mn	123	Incredible and Amazing

mn125:4.8	If not, then I will leave each to his own, and not question you about it further.”	mn125	4	8	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:5.1	Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had learned and memorized it.	mn125	5	1	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:5.2	When he had spoken, Jayasena said to him,	mn125	5	2	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:5.4	Having declared that this was impossible, Jayasena got up from his seat and left.	mn125	5	4	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:6.1	Not long after he had left, Aciravata went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	mn125	6	1	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:6.2	and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.	mn125	6	2	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:7.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	mn125	7	1	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:7.3	Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more.

mn125:9.1	Suppose there was a big mountain not far from a town or village.	mn125	9	1	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:9.2	And two friends set out from that village or town, lending each other a hand up to the mountain. Once there, one friend would remain at the foot of the mountain, while the other would climb to the peak.	mn125	9	2	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:9.3	The one standing at the foot would say to the one at the peak,	mn125	9	3	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:9.9	So their friend would come down from the peak, take their friend by the arm, and make them climb to the peak. After giving them a while to catch their breath, they’d say,	mn125	9	9	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:9.10	‘My friend, what do you see, standing here at the peak?’	mn125	9	10	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:12.8	‘Sire, the wild elephant has come out into the open.’	mn125	12	8	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:12.10	‘Please, my good elephant trainer, tame the wild bull elephant. Subdue its wild behaviors, its wild memories and thoughts, and its wild stress, weariness, and fever.

mn125:12.11	‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the elephant trainer. He dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck, so as to subdue its wild behaviors, its wild memories and thoughts, and its wild stress, weariness, and fever, and to make it happy to be within a village, and instill behaviors congenial to humans.	mn125	12	11	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.12	He spoke in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.	mn125	12	12	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.13	Spoken to in such a way by the elephant trainer, the wild elephant wanted to listen. It actively listened and tried to understand.	mn125	12	13	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.14	So the elephant trainer rewards it with grass, fodder, and water.	mn125	12	14	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.15	When the wild elephant accepts the grass, fodder, and water, the trainer knows,	mn125	12	15	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.16	‘Now the wild elephant will survive!’	mn125	12	16	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:12.18	‘Pick it up, worthy sir! Put it down, worthy sir!’	mn125	12	18	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.19	When the wild elephant picks up and puts down when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets it a further task:	mn125	12	19	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.20	‘Forward, worthy sir! Back, worthy sir!’	mn125	12	20	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn125:12.22	‘Stand, worthy sir! Sit, worthy sir!’	mn125	12	22	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.23	When the wild elephant stands and sits when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets the task called imperturbability. He fastens a large plank to its trunk; a lancer sits on its neck; other lancers surround it on all sides; and the trainer himself stands in front with a long lance.	mn125	12	23	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.24	While practicing this task, it doesn’t budge its fore-feet or hind-feet, its fore-quarters or hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, tail, or trunk.	mn125	12	24	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed
mn125:12.25	The wild bull elephant endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and tom-toms.

mn125:13.3	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn125	13	3	mn	125	The Level of the Tamed

mn126:4.11	I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.	mn126	4	11	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:4.12	But it’s possible that he might explain it like that.”	mn126	4	12	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:5.1	“If that’s what your teacher says, worthy Bhūmija, he clearly stands head and shoulders above all the various other ascetics and brahmins.”	mn126	5	1	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:6.1	Then Prince Jayasena served Venerable Bhūmija from his own dish.	mn126	6	1	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:7.1	Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, Bhūmija went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened, adding:	mn126	7	1	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:7.25	“Answering this way, I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said, and didn’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.”	mn126	7	25	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:8.1	“Indeed, Bhūmija, in answering this way you repeated what I’ve said, and didn’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation was in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuttal or criticism.	mn126	8	1	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:9.1	There are some ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether they make a wish,	mn126	9	1	mn	126	With Bhūmija

mn126:10.2	But by doing this, they couldn’t extract any oil, regardless of whether they made a wish,	mn126	10	2	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:10.3	didn’t make a wish,	mn126	10	3	mn	126	With Bhūmija

mn126:10.7	Because that’s an irrational way to extract oil.	mn126	10	7	mn	126	With Bhūmija

mn126:19.2	“But sir, how could these four similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha, since they were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past?”	mn126	19	2	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:19.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn126	19	3	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn126:19.4	Satisfied, Venerable Bhūmija approved what the Buddha said.	mn126	19	4	mn	126	With Bhūmija
mn127:1.1	So I have heard.	mn127	1	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn127	1	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.1	And then the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga addressed a man,	mn127	2	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.2	“Please, worthy man, go to Venerable Anuruddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him,	mn127	2	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.3	‘Sir, the chamberlain Pañcakaṅga bows with his head to your feet.’	mn127	2	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.4	And then ask him whether he	mn127	2	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.5	might please accept tomorrow’s meal from Pañcakaṅga together with the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn127	2	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.6	And ask whether he might please come earlier than usual,	mn127	2	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.7	for Pañcakaṅga has many duties, and much work to do for the king.”	mn127	2	7	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.8	“Yes, sir,” that man replied. He did as Pañcakaṅga asked, and	mn127	2	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:2.13	Venerable Anuruddha consented with silence.	mn127	2	13	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:3.1	Then when the night had passed, Anuruddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Pañcakaṅga’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out.	mn127	3	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:3.2	Then Pañcakaṅga served and satisfied Anuruddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	mn127	3	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:3.3	When Anuruddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Pañcakaṅga took a low seat, sat to one side,	mn127	3	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:3.4	and said to him:	mn127	3	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.1	“Sir, some senior mendicants have come to me and said,	mn127	4	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.2	‘Householder, develop the limitless release of heart.’	mn127	4	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.3	Others have said,	mn127	4	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.4	‘Householder, develop the expansive release of heart.’	mn127	4	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.5	Now, the limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart:	mn127	4	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:4.6	do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?”	mn127	4	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:5.1	“Well then, householder, let me know what you think about this. Afterwards you’ll get it without fail.”	mn127	5	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:5.2	“Sir, this is what I think.	mn127	5	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:5.3	The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.”	mn127	5	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:6.1	“The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart differ in both meaning and phrasing.	mn127	6	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:6.2	This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.	mn127	6	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:7.1	And what is the limitless release of the heart?	mn127	7	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:7.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.	mn127	7	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:7.3	They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …	mn127	7	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:7.4	They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …	mn127	7	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:7.5	They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

mn127:7.6	This is called the limitless release of the heart.	mn127	7	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.1	And what is the expansive release of the heart?	mn127	8	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive.	mn127	8	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.3	This is called the expansive release of the heart.	mn127	8	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.4	Also, a mendicant meditates focused on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots …	mn127	8	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.6	a single village district …	mn127	8	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:8.8	two or three village districts …	mn127	8	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha

mn127:9.1	Householder, there are these four kinds of rebirth in a future life.	mn127	9	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.2	What four?	mn127	9	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.3	Take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limited radiance’.	mn127	9	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.4	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limited radiance.	mn127	9	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.5	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘limitless radiance’.	mn127	9	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of limitless radiance.	mn127	9	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.7	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘corrupted radiance’.	mn127	9	7	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.8	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance.	mn127	9	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.9	Next, take someone who meditates focused on pervading ‘pure radiance’.	mn127	9	9	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.10	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance.	mn127	9	10	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:9.11	These are the four kinds of rebirth in a future life.	mn127	9	11	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:10.1	There comes a time, householder, when the deities gather together as one. When they do so, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.	mn127	10	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:10.2	It’s like when a person brings several oil lamps into one house.	mn127	10	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:10.3	You can detect a difference in their flames, but not in their radiance.	mn127	10	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:10.4	In the same way, when the deities gather together as one, a difference in their color is evident, but not in their radiance.	mn127	10	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:11.1	There comes a time when those deities go their separate ways. When they do so, a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident.	mn127	11	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:11.2	It’s like when a person takes those several oil lamps out of that house.	mn127	11	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:11.3	You can detect a difference both in their flames and also in their radiance.	mn127	11	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:11.4	In the same way, when the deities go their separate ways, a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident.	mn127	11	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.1	It’s not that those deities think,	mn127	12	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.2	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those deities cling, that’s where they take pleasure.	mn127	12	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.3	It’s like when flies are being carried along on a carrying-pole or basket. It’s not that they think,	mn127	12	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.4	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those flies cling, that’s where they take pleasure.	mn127	12	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.5	In the same way, it’s not that those deities think,	mn127	12	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:12.6	‘What we have is permanent, lasting, and eternal.’ Rather, wherever those deities cling, that’s where they take pleasure.”	mn127	12	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:13.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable Anuruddha:	mn127	13	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:13.2	“Good, Honorable Anuruddha!	mn127	13	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:13.3	I have a further question about this.	mn127	13	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:13.4	Do all the radiant deities have limited radiance, or do some there have limitless radiance?”	mn127	13	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:13.5	“In that respect, Reverend Kaccāna, some deities there have limited radiance, while some have limitless radiance.”	mn127	13	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.1	“What is the cause, Honorable Anuruddha, what is the reason why, when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods, some deities there have limited radiance, while some have limitless radiance?”	mn127	14	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.2	“Well then, Reverend Kaccāna, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.	mn127	14	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.3	What do you think, Reverend Kaccāna?	mn127	14	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.4	Which of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive: when a mendicant meditates focused on pervading as expansive the extent of a single tree root, or two or three tree roots?”	mn127	14	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.6	“When a mendicant meditates on two or three tree roots.”	mn127	14	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.8	“What do you think, Reverend Kaccāna?	mn127	14	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.9	Which of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive: when a mendicant meditates focused on pervading as expansive the extent of two or three tree roots, or a single village district …	mn127	14	9	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.13	two or three village districts …	mn127	14	13	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.17	a single kingdom …	mn127	14	17	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.21	two or three kingdoms …	mn127	14	21	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.25	this land surrounded by ocean?”	mn127	14	25	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.27	“When a mendicant meditates on this land surrounded by ocean.”	mn127	14	27	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:14.29	“This is the cause, Reverend Kaccāna, this is the reason why, when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods, some deities there have limited radiance, while some have limitless radiance.”	mn127	14	29	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:15.1	“Good, Honorable Anuruddha!	mn127	15	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:15.2	I have a further question about this.	mn127	15	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:15.3	Do all the radiant deities have corrupted radiance, or do some there have pure radiance?”	mn127	15	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:15.4	“In that respect, Reverend Kaccāna, some deities there have corrupted radiance, while some have pure radiance.”	mn127	15	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.1	“What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason why, when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods, some deities there have corrupted radiance, while some have pure radiance?”	mn127	16	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.2	“Well then, Reverend Kaccāna, I shall give you a simile.	mn127	16	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.3	For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.	mn127	16	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.4	Suppose an oil lamp was burning with impure oil and impure wick.	mn127	16	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.5	Because of the impurity of the oil and the wick it burns dimly, as it were.	mn127	16	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.6	In the same way, take some mendicant who meditates focused on pervading ‘corrupted radiance’.	mn127	16	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.7	Their physical discomfort is not completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse are not completely eliminated.	mn127	16	7	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.8	Because of this they practice absorption dimly, as it were.	mn127	16	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.9	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance.	mn127	16	9	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.10	Suppose an oil lamp was burning with pure oil and pure wick.	mn127	16	10	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.11	Because of the purity of the oil and the wick it doesn’t burn dimly, as it were.	mn127	16	11	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.12	In the same way, take some mendicant who meditates focused on pervading ‘pure radiance’.	mn127	16	12	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.13	Their physical discomfort is completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse is completely eliminated.	mn127	16	13	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.14	Because of this they don’t practice absorption dimly, as it were.	mn127	16	14	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.15	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance.	mn127	16	15	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:16.16	“This is the cause, Reverend Kaccāna, this is the reason why, when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods, some deities there have corrupted radiance, while some have pure radiance.”	mn127	16	16	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable Anuruddha,	mn127	17	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.2	“Good, Honorable Anuruddha!	mn127	17	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.3	Venerable Anuruddha, you don’t say,	mn127	17	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.4	‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’	mn127	17	4	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.5	Rather, you say: ‘These deities are like this, those deities are like that.’	mn127	17	5	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.6	Sir, it occurs to me,	mn127	17	6	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.7	‘Clearly, Venerable Anuruddha has previously lived together with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion.’”	mn127	17	7	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.8	“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Reverend Kaccāna.	mn127	17	8	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.9	Nevertheless, I will answer you.	mn127	17	9	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:17.10	For a long time I have previously lived together with those deities, conversed, and engaged in discussion.”	mn127	17	10	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:18.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna said to Pañcakaṅga the chamberlain,	mn127	18	1	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:18.2	“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate,	mn127	18	2	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn127:18.3	to have given up your state of uncertainty, and to have got the chance to listen to this exposition of the teaching.”	mn127	18	3	mn	127	With Anuruddha
mn128:1.1	So I have heard.	mn128	1	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	mn128	1	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:2.1	Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambī were arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words.	mn128	2	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:3.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him what was happening, adding:	mn128	3	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:3.3	“Please, sir go to those mendicants out of sympathy.”	mn128	3	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:3.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	mn128	3	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.1	Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said,	mn128	4	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.2	“Enough, mendicants! Stop arguing, quarreling, and disputing.”	mn128	4	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.3	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	mn128	4	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.4	“Wait, sir!	mn128	4	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.5	Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,	mn128	4	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.6	remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life.	mn128	4	6	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.7	We will be known for this arguing, quarreling, and disputing.”	mn128	4	7	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.8	For a second time …	mn128	4	8	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.15	and a third time the Buddha said to those mendicants,	mn128	4	15	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.16	“Enough, mendicants! Stop arguing, quarreling, and disputing.”	mn128	4	16	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.17	For a third time that mendicant said to the Buddha,	mn128	4	17	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.18	“Wait, sir!	mn128	4	18	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.19	Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,	mn128	4	19	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.20	remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in this life.	mn128	4	20	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:4.21	We will be known for this arguing, quarreling, and disputing.”	mn128	4	21	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:5.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.	mn128	5	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:5.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order. Taking his bowl and robe, he recited these verses while standing right there:	mn128	5	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.1	“Many voices shout at once,	mn128	6	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.2	yet no-one thinks that they’re the fool.	mn128	6	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.3	Even as the Saṅgha splits,	mn128	6	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.4	they think no better of the other.	mn128	6	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.5	Dolts pretending to be astute,	mn128	6	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.6	they talk, their words out of bounds.	mn128	6	6	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.7	They blab at will, their mouths agape,	mn128	6	7	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.8	and not one knows what leads them on.	mn128	6	8	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.9	‘They abused me, they hit me!	mn128	6	9	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.10	They beat me, they robbed me!’	mn128	6	10	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.11	For those bearing such a grudge,	mn128	6	11	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.12	hatred is never laid to rest.	mn128	6	12	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.13	‘They abused me, they hit me!	mn128	6	13	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.14	They beat me, they robbed me!’	mn128	6	14	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.15	For those who bear no such grudge,	mn128	6	15	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.16	hatred is laid to rest.	mn128	6	16	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.17	For never is hatred	mn128	6	17	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.18	laid to rest by hate,	mn128	6	18	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.19	it’s laid to rest by love:	mn128	6	19	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.20	this is an ancient teaching.	mn128	6	20	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.21	When others do not understand,	mn128	6	21	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.22	let us, who do understand this,	mn128	6	22	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.23	restrain ourselves in this regard;	mn128	6	23	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.24	for that is how conflicts are laid to rest.	mn128	6	24	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.25	Breakers of bones and takers of life,	mn128	6	25	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.26	thieves of cattle, horses, wealth,	mn128	6	26	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.27	those who plunder the nation:	mn128	6	27	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.28	even they can come together,	mn128	6	28	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.29	so why can’t you?	mn128	6	29	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.30	If you find an alert companion,	mn128	6	30	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.31	an attentive friend to live happily together,	mn128	6	31	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.32	then, overcoming all adversities,	mn128	6	32	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.33	wander with them, joyful and mindful.	mn128	6	33	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.34	If you find no alert companion,	mn128	6	34	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.35	no attentive friend to live happily together,	mn128	6	35	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.36	then, like a king who flees his conquered realm,	mn128	6	36	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.37	wander alone like a tusker in the wilds.	mn128	6	37	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.38	It’s better to wander alone,	mn128	6	38	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.39	there’s no fellowship with fools.	mn128	6	39	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.40	Wander alone and do no wrong,	mn128	6	40	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:6.41	at ease like a tusker in the wilds.”	mn128	6	41	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.1	After speaking these verses while standing, the Buddha went to the village of the child salt-miners,	mn128	7	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.2	where Venerable Bhagu was staying at the time.	mn128	7	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.3	Bhagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,	mn128	7	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.4	so he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.	mn128	7	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.5	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	mn128	7	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.6	and washed his feet.	mn128	7	6	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.7	Bhagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.	mn128	7	7	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.8	The Buddha said to him,	mn128	7	8	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.9	“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn128	7	9	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.10	“I’m keeping well, Blessed One; I’m all right. And I’m having no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn128	7	10	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:7.11	Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Bhagu with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and set out for the Eastern Bamboo Park.	mn128	7	11	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.1	Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Park.	mn128	8	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.2	The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance	mn128	8	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.3	and said to the Buddha,	mn128	8	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.4	“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.	mn128	8	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.5	There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire only the self.	mn128	8	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:8.6	Don’t disturb them.”	mn128	8	6	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:9.1	Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,	mn128	9	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:9.2	and said to him,	mn128	9	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:9.3	“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!	mn128	9	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:9.4	Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”	mn128	9	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.1	Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,	mn128	10	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.2	“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”	mn128	10	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.3	Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.	mn128	10	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.4	One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.	mn128	10	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.5	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out	mn128	10	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.6	and washed his feet.	mn128	10	6	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.7	Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.	mn128	10	7	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.8	The Buddha said to Anuruddha,	mn128	10	8	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.9	“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn128	10	9	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:10.10	“We’re keeping well, Blessed One; we’re all right. And we’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”	mn128	10	10	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:11.1	“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”	mn128	11	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:11.2	“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony as you say.”	mn128	11	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:11.3	“But how do you live this way?”	mn128	11	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.1	“In this case, sir, I think:	mn128	12	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.2	‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,	mn128	12	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.3	to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’	mn128	12	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.4	I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.	mn128	12	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.7	I think:	mn128	12	7	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.8	‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’	mn128	12	8	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.9	And that’s what I do.	mn128	12	9	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.10	Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”	mn128	12	10	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.11	And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:	mn128	12	11	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:12.23	“That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”	mn128	12	23	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:13.1	“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!	mn128	13	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:13.2	But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”	mn128	13	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:14.1	“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”	mn128	14	1	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:14.2	“But how do you live this way?”	mn128	14	2	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:14.3	“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.	mn128	14	3	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:14.4	If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.	mn128	14	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:14.5	Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.	mn128	14	5	mn	128	Corruptions

mn128:32.1	When I had developed immersion in these ways,	mn128	32	1	mn	128	Corruptions

mn128:32.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn128	32	4	mn	128	Corruptions
mn128:32.5	Satisfied, Venerable Anuruddha approved what the Buddha said.	mn128	32	5	mn	128	Corruptions
mn129:1.1	So I have heard.	mn129	1	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn129	1	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn129	1	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn129	1	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn129	1	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn129	1	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.1	“These are the three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of a fool.	mn129	2	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.2	What three?	mn129	2	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.3	A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts poorly.	mn129	2	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.4	If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then how would the astute know of them,	mn129	2	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.5	‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’?	mn129	2	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.6	But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then the astute do know of them,	mn129	2	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:2.7	‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’.	mn129	2	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.1	A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in this very life.	mn129	3	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.2	Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,	mn129	3	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.3	where people are discussing what is proper and fitting.	mn129	3	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.4	And suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	mn129	3	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.5	Then that fool thinks,	mn129	3	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.6	‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.	mn129	3	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.7	But those bad things are found in me and I exhibit them!’	mn129	3	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:3.8	This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.	mn129	3	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.1	Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—	mn129	4	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.2	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.	mn129	4	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.3	Then that fool thinks,	mn129	4	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.4	‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments—	mn129	4	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.6	those things are found in me and I exhibit them!	mn129	4	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.7	If the kings find out about me, they will inflict the same kinds of punishments on me!’	mn129	4	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:4.9	This is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.	mn129	4	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.1	Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.	mn129	5	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.2	It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.	mn129	5	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.3	In the same way, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.	mn129	5	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.4	Then that fool thinks,	mn129	5	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.5	‘Alas, I haven’t done good and skillful things that keep me safe.	mn129	5	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.6	And I have done bad things, violence and sin.	mn129	5	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.7	When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’	mn129	5	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.8	They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breasts and falling into confusion.	mn129	5	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:5.9	This is the third kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life.	mn129	5	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:6.1	Having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn129	6	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:7.1	And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that	mn129	7	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:7.2	it is utterly unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable, it is of hell that this should be said.	mn129	7	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:7.4	So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how painful hell is.”	mn129	7	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:7.5	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	mn129	7	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:7.6	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	mn129	7	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.1	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	mn129	8	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.2	“Suppose they arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying,	mn129	8	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.3	‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’	mn129	8	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.4	The king would say,	mn129	8	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.5	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’	mn129	8	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.6	The king’s men did as they were told.	mn129	8	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.7	Then at midday the king would say,	mn129	8	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.8	‘My men, how is that man?’	mn129	8	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.9	‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’	mn129	8	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.10	The king would say,	mn129	8	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.11	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the midday with a hundred spears!’	mn129	8	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.12	The king’s men did as they were told.	mn129	8	12	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.13	Then late in the afternoon the king would say,	mn129	8	13	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.14	‘My men, how is that man?’	mn129	8	14	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.15	‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’	mn129	8	15	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.16	The king would say,	mn129	8	16	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.17	‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’	mn129	8	17	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.18	The king’s men did as they were told.	mn129	8	18	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.19	What do you think, mendicants?	mn129	8	19	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.20	Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears?”	mn129	8	20	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:8.21	“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”	mn129	8	21	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:9.1	Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,	mn129	9	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:9.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	mn129	9	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:9.3	Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”	mn129	9	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:9.4	“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.”	mn129	9	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:9.5	“In the same way, compared to the suffering in hell, the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.	mn129	9	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:10.1	The wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.	mn129	10	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:10.2	They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.	mn129	10	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:10.3	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn129	10	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:11.1	The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …	mn129	11	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:12.1	They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …	mn129	12	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:13.1	They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …	mn129	13	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:14.1	They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …	mn129	14	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:15.1	The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them into a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.	mn129	15	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:15.3	There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.	mn129	15	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:15.4	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn129	15	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.1	The wardens of hell toss them in the Great Hell.	mn129	16	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.2	Now, about that Great Hell:	mn129	16	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.3	‘Four are its corners, four its doors,	mn129	16	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.4	neatly divided in equal parts.	mn129	16	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.5	Surrounded by an iron wall,	mn129	16	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.6	of iron is its roof.	mn129	16	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.7	The ground is even made of iron,	mn129	16	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.8	it burns with fierce fire.	mn129	16	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.9	The heat forever radiates	mn129	16	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:16.10	a hundred leagues around.’	mn129	16	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:17.1	I could tell you many different things about hell.	mn129	17	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:17.2	So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in hell.	mn129	17	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:18.1	There are, mendicants, animals that feed on grass.	mn129	18	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:18.2	They eat by cropping fresh or dried grass with their teeth.	mn129	18	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:18.3	And what animals feed on grass?	mn129	18	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:18.4	Elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, goats, deer, and various others.	mn129	18	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:18.5	A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on grass.	mn129	18	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.1	There are animals that feed on dung.	mn129	19	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.2	When they catch a whiff of dung they run to it, thinking,	mn129	19	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.3	‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’	mn129	19	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.4	It’s like when brahmins smell a burnt offering, they run to it, thinking,	mn129	19	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.5	‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’	mn129	19	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.6	In the same way, there are animals that feed on dung.	mn129	19	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.7	When they catch a whiff of dung they run to it, thinking,	mn129	19	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.8	‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’	mn129	19	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.9	And what animals feed on dung?	mn129	19	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.10	Chickens, pigs, dogs, jackals, and various others.	mn129	19	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:19.11	A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on dung.	mn129	19	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:20.1	There are animals who are born, live, and die in darkness.	mn129	20	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:20.2	And what animals are born, live, and die in darkness?	mn129	20	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:20.3	Moths, maggots, earthworms, and various others.	mn129	20	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:20.4	A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in darkness.	mn129	20	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:21.1	There are animals who are born, live, and die in water.	mn129	21	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:21.2	And what animals are born, live, and die in water?	mn129	21	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:21.3	Fish, turtles, crocodiles, and various others.	mn129	21	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:21.4	A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in water.	mn129	21	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.1	There are animals who are born, live, and die in filth.	mn129	22	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.2	And what animals are born, live, and die in filth?	mn129	22	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.3	Those animals that are born, live, and die in a rotten fish, a rotten carcass,	mn129	22	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.4	rotten porridge,	mn129	22	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.5	or a sewer.	mn129	22	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:22.7	A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in filth.	mn129	22	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:23.1	I could tell you many different things about the animal realm.	mn129	23	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:23.2	So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in the animal realm.	mn129	23	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.1	Mendicants, suppose a person were to throw a yoke with a single hole into the ocean.	mn129	24	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.2	The east wind wafts it west; the west wind wafts it east; the north wind wafts it south; and the south wind wafts it north.	mn129	24	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.3	And there was a one-eyed turtle who popped up once every hundred years.	mn129	24	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.4	What do you think, mendicants?	mn129	24	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.5	Would that one-eyed turtle still poke its neck through the hole in that yoke?”	mn129	24	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.6	“No, sir.	mn129	24	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.7	Only after a very long time, sir, if ever.”	mn129	24	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.8	“That one-eyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a human being, I say.	mn129	24	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.9	Why is that?	mn129	24	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.10	Because in that place there’s no principled or moral conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful.	mn129	24	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:24.11	There they just prey on each other, preying on the weak.	mn129	24	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.1	And suppose that fool, after a very long time, returned to the human realm.	mn129	25	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.2	They’d be reborn in a low class family—a family of corpse-workers, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or scavengers.	mn129	25	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.3	Such families are poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.	mn129	25	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.4	And they’d be ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.	mn129	25	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.5	And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn129	25	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:25.6	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn129	25	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:26.1	Suppose a gambler were to lose his wife and child, all his property, and then get thrown in jail with his first losing hand.	mn129	26	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:26.2	Such a losing hand is trivial compared to	mn129	26	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:26.3	the losing hand whereby a fool, having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	mn129	26	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:26.4	This is the total fulfillment of the fool’s level.	mn129	26	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:27.1	There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of an astute person.	mn129	27	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:27.2	What three?	mn129	27	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:27.3	An astute person thinks well, speaks well, and acts well.	mn129	27	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:27.4	If an astute person didn’t think well, speak well, and act well, then how would the astute know of them,	mn129	27	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:27.5	‘This worthy one is astute, a true person’?	mn129	27	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.1	But since an astute person does think well, speak well, and act well, then the astute do know of them,	mn129	28	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.2	‘This worthy one is astute, a true person’.	mn129	28	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.3	An astute person experiences three kinds of pleasure and happiness in this very life.	mn129	28	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.4	Suppose an astute person is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,	mn129	28	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.5	where people are discussing about what is proper and fitting.	mn129	28	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.6	And suppose that astute person is someone who refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants.	mn129	28	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.7	Then that astute person thinks,	mn129	28	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.8	‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.	mn129	28	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.9	And those good things are found in me and I exhibit them.’	mn129	28	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:28.10	This is the first kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in this very life.	mn129	28	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:29.1	Furthermore, an astute person sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—	mn129	29	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:29.2	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.	mn129	29	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:29.3	Then that astute person thinks,	mn129	29	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:29.4	‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments—those things are not found in me and I do not exhibit them!’	mn129	29	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:29.5	This is the second kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in this very life.	mn129	29	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.1	Furthermore, when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past good deeds—good conduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.	mn129	30	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.2	It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.	mn129	30	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.3	In the same way, when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past good deeds—good conduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.	mn129	30	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.4	Then that astute person thinks,	mn129	30	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.5	‘Well, I haven’t done bad things, violence and sin.	mn129	30	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.6	And I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safe.	mn129	30	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.7	When I pass away, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’	mn129	30	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.8	So they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.	mn129	30	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:30.9	This is the third kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in this very life.	mn129	30	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:31.1	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	mn129	31	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:32.1	And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that	mn129	32	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:32.2	it is utterly likable, desirable, and agreeable, it is of heaven that this should be said.	mn129	32	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:32.4	So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how pleasurable heaven is.”	mn129	32	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:32.5	When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,	mn129	32	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:32.6	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	mn129	32	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:33.1	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	mn129	33	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:33.2	“Suppose there was a king, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed seven treasures and four blessings, and experienced pleasure and happiness because of them.	mn129	33	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:34.1	What seven?	mn129	34	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:34.2	It’s when, on the fifteenth day sabbath, an anointed aristocratic king has bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. And the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.	mn129	34	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:34.3	Seeing this, the king thinks,	mn129	34	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:34.4	‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	34	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:34.5	Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’	mn129	34	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.1	Then the anointed aristocratic king, taking a ceremonial vase in his left hand, besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying,	mn129	35	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.2	‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’	mn129	35	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.3	Then the wheel-treasure rolls towards the east. And the king follows it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stands still, there the king comes to stay together with his army.	mn129	35	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.4	And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter come to the wheel-turning monarch and say,	mn129	35	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.5	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	mn129	35	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.6	The wheel-turning monarch says,	mn129	35	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.7	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	mn129	35	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.8	And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter become his vassals.	mn129	35	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.9	Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolls towards the south. …	mn129	35	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.10	Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolls towards the west. …	mn129	35	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.11	Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolls towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stands still, there the king comes to stay together with his army.	mn129	35	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.12	And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter come to the wheel-turning monarch and say,	mn129	35	12	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.13	‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’	mn129	35	13	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.14	The wheel-turning monarch says,	mn129	35	14	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.15	‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’	mn129	35	15	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.16	And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter become his vassals.	mn129	35	16	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.17	And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returns to the royal capital. There it stands still at the gate to the royal compound as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound.	mn129	35	17	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:35.18	Such is the wheel-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	35	18	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.1	Next, the elephant-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	36	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.2	It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath.	mn129	36	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.3	Seeing him, the king was impressed,	mn129	36	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.4	‘This would truly be a fine elephant vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’	mn129	36	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.5	Then the elephant-treasure submitted to taming, as if he were a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed for a long time.	mn129	36	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.6	Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same elephant-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.	mn129	36	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:36.7	Such is the elephant-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	36	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.1	Next, the horse-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	37	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.2	It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, with head of black and mane like woven reeds, a royal steed named Thundercloud.	mn129	37	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.3	Seeing him, the king was impressed,	mn129	37	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.4	‘This would truly be a fine horse vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’	mn129	37	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.5	Then the horse-treasure submitted to taming, as if he were a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a long time.	mn129	37	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.6	Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same horse-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.	mn129	37	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:37.7	Such is the horse-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	37	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.1	Next, the jewel-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	38	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.2	It is a beryl gem that’s naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked.	mn129	38	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.3	And the radiance of that jewel spreads all-round for a league.	mn129	38	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.4	Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same jewel-treasure, mobilized his army of four divisions and, with the jewel hoisted on his banner, set out in the dark of the night.	mn129	38	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.5	Then the villagers around them set off to work, thinking that it was day.	mn129	38	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:38.6	Such is the jewel-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	38	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.1	Next, the woman-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	39	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.2	She is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. She’s neither too tall nor too short; neither too thin nor too fat; neither too dark nor too light. She outdoes human beauty without reaching heavenly beauty.	mn129	39	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.3	And her touch is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok.	mn129	39	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.4	When it’s cool her limbs are warm, and when it’s warm her limbs are cool.	mn129	39	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.5	The fragrance of sandal floats from her body, and lotus from her mouth.	mn129	39	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.6	She gets up before the king and goes to bed after him, and is obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.	mn129	39	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.7	The woman-treasure does not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed.	mn129	39	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:39.8	Such is the woman-treasure who appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	39	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.1	Next, the householder-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	40	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.2	The power of clairvoyance manifests in him as a result of past deeds, by which he sees hidden treasure, both owned and ownerless.	mn129	40	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.3	He approaches the wheel-turning monarch and says,	mn129	40	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.4	‘Relax, sire. I will take care of the treasury.’	mn129	40	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.5	Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure,	mn129	40	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.6	‘Householder, I need gold, both coined and uncoined.’	mn129	40	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.7	‘Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.’	mn129	40	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.8	‘It’s right here, householder, that I need gold, both coined and uncoined.’	mn129	40	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.9	Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold, both coined and uncoined, and said to the king,	mn129	40	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.10	‘Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king, enough offered?’	mn129	40	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.11	The wheel-turning monarch said,	mn129	40	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.12	‘That is sufficient, householder. Enough has been done, enough offered.’	mn129	40	12	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:40.13	Such is the householder-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	40	13	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.1	Next, the commander-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	41	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.2	He is astute, competent, intelligent, and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained.	mn129	41	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.3	He approaches the wheel-turning monarch and says,	mn129	41	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.4	‘Relax, sire. I shall issue instructions.’	mn129	41	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.5	Such is the commander-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	41	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:41.6	These are the seven treasures possessed by a wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	41	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:42.1	And what are the four blessings?	mn129	42	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:42.2	A wheel-turning monarch is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so than other humans.	mn129	42	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:42.3	This is the first blessing.	mn129	42	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:43.1	Furthermore, he is long-lived, more so than other humans.	mn129	43	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:43.2	This is the second blessing.	mn129	43	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:44.1	Furthermore, he is rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other humans.	mn129	44	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:44.2	This is the third blessing.	mn129	44	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.1	Furthermore, a wheel-turning monarch is as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders	mn129	45	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.2	as a father is to his children.	mn129	45	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.4	And the brahmins and householders are as dear to the wheel-turning monarch	mn129	45	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.5	as children are to their father.	mn129	45	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.7	Once it so happened that a wheel-turning monarch went with his army of four divisions to visit a park.	mn129	45	7	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.8	Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said,	mn129	45	8	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.9	‘Slow down, Your Majesty, so we may see you longer!’	mn129	45	9	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.10	And the king addressed his charioteer,	mn129	45	10	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.11	‘Drive slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!’	mn129	45	11	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.12	This is the fourth blessing.	mn129	45	12	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:45.13	These are the four blessings possessed by a wheel-turning monarch.	mn129	45	13	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:46.1	What do you think, mendicants?	mn129	46	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:46.2	Would a wheel-turning monarch who possessed these seven treasures and these four blessings experience pleasure and happiness because of them?”	mn129	46	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:46.3	“Sir, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed even a single one of these treasures would experience pleasure and happiness because of that, let alone all seven treasures and four blessings!”	mn129	46	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:47.1	Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,	mn129	47	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:47.2	“What do you think, mendicants?	mn129	47	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:47.3	Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”	mn129	47	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:47.4	“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.”	mn129	47	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:47.5	“In the same way, compared to the happiness of heaven, the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheel-turning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison.	mn129	47	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:48.1	And suppose that astute person, after a very long time, returned to the human realm.	mn129	48	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:48.2	They’d be reborn in a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain.	mn129	48	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:48.3	And they’d be attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They’d get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and a bed, house, and lighting.	mn129	48	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:48.4	And they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn129	48	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:48.5	When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	mn129	48	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.1	Suppose a gambler was to win a big pile of money with the first perfect hand.	mn129	49	1	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.2	Such a perfect hand is trivial compared to	mn129	49	2	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.3	the perfect hand whereby an astute person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	mn129	49	3	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.4	This is the total fulfillment of the astute person’s level.”	mn129	49	4	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.5	That is what the Buddha said.	mn129	49	5	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn129:49.6	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn129	49	6	mn	129	The Foolish and the Astute
mn130:1.1	So I have heard.	mn130	1	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn130	1	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn130	1	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn130	1	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn130	1	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn130	1	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.	mn130	2	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:2.2	In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’	mn130	2	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.1	The wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying,	mn130	3	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.2	‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family.	mn130	3	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.3	May Your Majesty punish them!’	mn130	3	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.4	King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods.	mn130	3	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.5	‘Worthy man, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	mn130	3	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.6	He says,	mn130	3	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:3.7	‘I saw nothing, sir.’	mn130	3	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.1	King Yama says to them,	mn130	4	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.2	‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a little baby collapsed in their own urine and feces?’	mn130	4	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.3	He says,	mn130	4	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.4	‘I saw that, sir.’	mn130	4	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.5	King Yama says to them,	mn130	4	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.6	‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—	mn130	4	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.7	“I, too, am liable to be born. I’m not exempt from rebirth. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’	mn130	4	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.8	He says,	mn130	4	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.9	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’	mn130	4	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.10	King Yama says to them,	mn130	4	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.11	‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn130	4	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.12	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.	mn130	4	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:4.13	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’	mn130	4	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.1	Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods.	mn130	5	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.2	‘Worthy man, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	mn130	5	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.3	He says,	mn130	5	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’	mn130	5	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.5	King Yama says to them,	mn130	5	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.6	‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’	mn130	5	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.7	He says,	mn130	5	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.8	‘I saw that, sir.’	mn130	5	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.9	King Yama says to them,	mn130	5	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.10	‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—	mn130	5	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.11	“I, too, am liable to grow old. I’m not exempt from old age. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’	mn130	5	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.12	He says,	mn130	5	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.13	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’	mn130	5	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.14	King Yama says to them,	mn130	5	14	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.15	‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn130	5	15	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.16	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.	mn130	5	16	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:5.17	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’	mn130	5	17	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.1	Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods.	mn130	6	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.2	‘Worthy man, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	mn130	6	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.3	He says,	mn130	6	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’	mn130	6	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.5	King Yama says to them,	mn130	6	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.6	‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’	mn130	6	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.7	He says,	mn130	6	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.8	‘I saw that, sir.’	mn130	6	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.9	King Yama says to them,	mn130	6	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.10	‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—	mn130	6	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.11	“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’	mn130	6	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.12	He says,	mn130	6	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.13	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’	mn130	6	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.14	King Yama says to them,	mn130	6	14	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.15	‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn130	6	15	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.16	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.	mn130	6	16	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:6.17	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’	mn130	6	17	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.1	Then King Yama grills them about the fourth messenger of the gods.	mn130	7	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.2	‘Worthy man, did you not see the fourth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	mn130	7	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.3	He says,	mn130	7	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’	mn130	7	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.5	King Yama says to them,	mn130	7	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.6	‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings when the rulers arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—	mn130	7	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.7	whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded?’	mn130	7	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.8	He says,	mn130	7	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.9	‘I saw that, sir.’	mn130	7	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.10	King Yama says to them,	mn130	7	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.11	‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—	mn130	7	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.12	that if someone who does bad deeds receives such punishment in this very life, what must happen to them in the next; I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’	mn130	7	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.13	He says,	mn130	7	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.14	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’	mn130	7	14	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.15	King Yama says to them,	mn130	7	15	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.16	‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn130	7	16	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.17	Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence.	mn130	7	17	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:7.18	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’	mn130	7	18	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.1	Then King Yama grills them about the fifth messenger of the gods.	mn130	8	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.2	‘Worthy man, did you not see the fifth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’	mn130	8	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.3	He says,	mn130	8	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.4	‘I saw nothing, sir.’	mn130	8	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.5	King Yama says to them,	mn130	8	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.6	‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering?’	mn130	8	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.7	He says,	mn130	8	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.8	‘I saw that, sir.’	mn130	8	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.9	King Yama says to them,	mn130	8	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.10	‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—	mn130	8	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.11	“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’	mn130	8	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.12	He says,	mn130	8	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.13	‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’	mn130	8	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.14	King Yama says to them,	mn130	8	14	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:8.15	‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind.	mn130	8	15	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods

mn130:8.17	That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’	mn130	8	17	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:9.1	After grilling them about the fifth messenger of the gods, King Yama falls silent.	mn130	9	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:10.1	The wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.	mn130	10	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:10.2	They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.	mn130	10	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:10.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	10	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:11.1	The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …	mn130	11	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:12.1	They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …	mn130	12	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:13.1	They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …	mn130	13	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:14.1	They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …	mn130	14	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:15.1	The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.	mn130	15	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:15.3	There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.	mn130	15	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:15.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	15	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.1	The wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell.	mn130	16	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.2	Now, about that Great Hell:	mn130	16	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.3	‘Four are its corners, four its doors,	mn130	16	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.4	neatly divided in equal parts.	mn130	16	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.5	Surrounded by an iron wall,	mn130	16	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.6	of iron is its roof.	mn130	16	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.7	The ground is even made of iron,	mn130	16	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.8	it burns with fierce fire.	mn130	16	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.9	The heat forever radiates	mn130	16	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:16.10	a hundred leagues around.’	mn130	16	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:17.1	Now in the Great Hell, flames surge out of the walls and crash into the opposite wall: from east to west, from west to east, from north to south, from south to north, from bottom to top, from top to bottom.	mn130	17	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:17.2	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	17	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	mn130	18	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.2	So they run there as fast as they can.	mn130	18	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.3	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	mn130	18	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.4	but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut.	mn130	18	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.5	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	18	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.6	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the western gate …	mn130	18	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.7	northern gate …	mn130	18	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.8	southern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	mn130	18	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.9	So they run there as fast as they can.	mn130	18	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.10	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	mn130	18	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.11	but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut.	mn130	18	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:18.12	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	18	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:19.1	There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened.	mn130	19	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:19.2	So they run there as fast as they can.	mn130	19	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:19.3	And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape;	mn130	19	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:19.4	and they make it out that door.	mn130	19	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:20.1	Immediately adjacent to the Great Hell is the vast Dung Hell.	mn130	20	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:20.2	And that’s where they fall.	mn130	20	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:20.3	In that Dung Hell there are needle-mouthed creatures that bore through the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, sinews, and bones, until they reach the marrow and devour it.	mn130	20	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:20.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	20	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:21.1	Immediately adjacent to the Dung Hell is the vast Hell of Burning Chaff.	mn130	21	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:21.2	And that’s where they fall.	mn130	21	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:21.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	21	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:22.1	Immediately adjacent to the Hell of Burning Chaff is the vast Red Silk-Cotton Forest. It’s a league high, full of sixteen-inch thorns, burning, blazing, and glowing.	mn130	22	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:22.2	And there they make them climb up and down.	mn130	22	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:22.3	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	22	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:23.1	Immediately adjacent to the Red Silk-Cotton Forest is the vast Sword-Leaf Forest.	mn130	23	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:23.2	They enter that.	mn130	23	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:23.3	There the fallen leaves blown by the wind cut their hands, feet, both hands and feet; they cut their ears, nose, both ears and nose.	mn130	23	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:23.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	23	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:24.1	Immediately adjacent to the Sword-Leaf Forest is the vast Acid River.	mn130	24	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:24.2	And that’s where they fall.	mn130	24	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:24.3	There they are swept upstream, swept downstream, and swept both up and down stream.	mn130	24	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:24.4	And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	24	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.1	The wardens of hell pull them out with a hook and place them on dry land, and say,	mn130	25	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.2	‘Worthy man, what do you want?’	mn130	25	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.3	They say,	mn130	25	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.4	‘I’m hungry, sir.’	mn130	25	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.5	The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and shove in a red-hot copper ball, burning, blazing, and glowing.	mn130	25	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.6	It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails.	mn130	25	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:25.7	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	25	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.1	The wardens of hell say,	mn130	26	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.2	‘Worthy man, what do you want?’	mn130	26	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.3	They say,	mn130	26	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.4	‘I’m thirsty, sir.’	mn130	26	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.5	The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and pour in molten copper, burning, blazing, and glowing.	mn130	26	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.6	It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails.	mn130	26	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:26.7	And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.	mn130	26	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:27.1	The wardens of hell toss them back in the Great Hell.	mn130	27	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:28.1	Once upon a time, King Yama thought:	mn130	28	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:28.2	‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments.	mn130	28	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:28.3	Oh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha!	mn130	28	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:28.4	Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’	mn130	28	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:29.1	Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”	mn130	29	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn130	30	1	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	mn130	30	2	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.3	“When warned by the gods’ messengers,	mn130	30	3	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.4	those sons of Manu who are negligent	mn130	30	4	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.5	sorrow for a long time	mn130	30	5	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.6	when they go to that wretched place.	mn130	30	6	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.7	When warned by the gods’ messengers,	mn130	30	7	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.8	the good and true persons here	mn130	30	8	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.9	never neglect	mn130	30	9	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.10	the teaching of the Noble One.	mn130	30	10	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.11	Seeing the danger in grasping,	mn130	30	11	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.12	the origin of birth and death,	mn130	30	12	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.13	the unattached are freed	mn130	30	13	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.14	with the ending of birth and death.	mn130	30	14	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.15	Happy, they’ve come to a safe place,	mn130	30	15	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.16	quenched in this very life.	mn130	30	16	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.17	They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils,	mn130	30	17	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn130:30.18	and risen above all suffering.”	mn130	30	18	mn	130	Messengers of the Gods
mn131:1.1	So I have heard.	mn131	1	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn131	1	2	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	mn131	1	3	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:1.4	“Mendicants!”	mn131	1	4	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	mn131	1	5	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:1.6	The Buddha said this:	mn131	1	6	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:2.1	“I shall teach you the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.	mn131	2	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:2.2	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn131	2	2	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:2.3	“Yes, sir,” they replied.	mn131	2	3	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:2.4	The Buddha said this:	mn131	2	4	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.1	“Don’t run back to the past,	mn131	3	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.2	don’t anticipate the future.	mn131	3	2	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.3	What’s past is left behind,	mn131	3	3	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.4	the future has not arrived;	mn131	3	4	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.5	and any present phenomenon	mn131	3	5	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.6	you clearly discern in every case.	mn131	3	6	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	mn131	3	7	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.8	having known that, foster it.	mn131	3	8	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.9	Today’s the day to keenly work—	mn131	3	9	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	mn131	3	10	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	mn131	3	11	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	mn131	3	12	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	mn131	3	13	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.14	tireless all night and day:	mn131	3	14	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.15	that’s who has one fine night—	mn131	3	15	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:3.16	so declares the peaceful sage.	mn131	3	16	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:4.1	And how do you run back to the past?	mn131	4	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:4.2	You muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’	mn131	4	2	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:4.3	That’s how you run back to the past.	mn131	4	3	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:5.1	And how do you not run back to the past?	mn131	5	1	mn	131	One Fine Night

mn131:8.1	And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?	mn131	8	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:8.2	It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.	mn131	8	2	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:8.3	They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.	mn131	8	3	mn	131	One Fine Night

mn131:10.16	so declares the peaceful sage.’	mn131	10	16	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:11.1	And that’s what I meant when I said: ‘I shall teach you the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.’”	mn131	11	1	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:11.3	That is what the Buddha said.	mn131	11	3	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn131:11.4	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn131	11	4	mn	131	One Fine Night
mn132:1.1	So I have heard.	mn132	1	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn132	1	2	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.	mn132	2	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.2	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out,	mn132	2	2	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.3	and addressed the mendicants,	mn132	2	3	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.4	“Who was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	mn132	2	4	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.5	“It was Venerable Ānanda, sir.”	mn132	2	5	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.6	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn132	2	6	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:2.7	“But in what way were you inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	mn132	2	7	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:3.1	“I was doing so in this way, sir,” replied Ānanda.	mn132	3	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:3.2	“Don’t run back to the past,	mn132	3	2	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night

mn132:9.1	And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena? …	mn132	9	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:9.8	That’s how you don’t falter amid presently arisen phenomena.	mn132	9	8	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:10.1	‘Don’t run back to the past,	mn132	10	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:10.2	don’t anticipate the future. …	mn132	10	2	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night

mn132:10.16	so declares the peaceful sage.’	mn132	10	16	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:11.1	That’s how I was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”	mn132	11	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:11.2	“Good, good, Ānanda.	mn132	11	2	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:11.3	It’s good that you were inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”	mn132	11	3	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:13-19.1	And the Buddha repeated the verses and analysis once more.	mn132	13-19	1	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:13-19.17	That is what the Buddha said.	mn132	13-19	17	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn132:13-19.18	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn132	13-19	18	mn	132	nanda and One Fine Night
mn133:1.1	So I have heard.	mn133	1	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.	mn133	1	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:1.3	Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.	mn133	1	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:1.4	When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs.	mn133	1	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:1.5	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, stood to one side, and said to Samiddhi:	mn133	1	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.1	“Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	mn133	2	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.2	“No, reverend, I do not.	mn133	2	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.3	Do you?”	mn133	2	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.4	“I also do not.	mn133	2	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.5	But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	mn133	2	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.6	“I do not.	mn133	2	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.7	Do you?”	mn133	2	7	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.8	“I also do not.	mn133	2	8	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.9	Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,	mn133	2	9	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.10	memorize it,	mn133	2	10	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.11	and remember it.	mn133	2	11	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.12	It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	mn133	2	12	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.13	That’s what that deity said,	mn133	2	13	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:2.14	before vanishing right there.	mn133	2	14	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:3.1	Then, when the night had passed, Samiddhi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:	mn133	3	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:4.15	“Sir, please teach me the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”	mn133	4	15	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:4.16	“Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn133	4	16	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:4.17	“Yes, sir,” Samiddhi replied.	mn133	4	17	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:4.18	The Buddha said this:	mn133	4	18	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.1	“Don’t run back to the past,	mn133	5	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.2	don’t anticipate the future.	mn133	5	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.3	What’s past is left behind,	mn133	5	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.4	the future has not arrived;	mn133	5	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.5	and any present phenomenon	mn133	5	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.6	you clearly discern in every case.	mn133	5	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	mn133	5	7	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.8	having known that, foster it.	mn133	5	8	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.9	Today’s the day to keenly work—	mn133	5	9	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	mn133	5	10	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	mn133	5	11	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	mn133	5	12	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	mn133	5	13	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.14	tireless all night and day:	mn133	5	14	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.15	that’s who has one fine night—	mn133	5	15	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:5.16	so declares the peaceful sage.”	mn133	5	16	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:6.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn133	6	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:6.2	When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.	mn133	6	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.1	Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,	mn133	7	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.2	“The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …	mn133	7	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.19	Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?”	mn133	7	19	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.20	Then those mendicants thought:	mn133	7	20	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.21	“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	mn133	7	21	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.22	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn133	7	22	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.23	Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”	mn133	7	23	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.24	Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn133	7	24	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:7.25	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said:	mn133	7	25	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:8.6	“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”	mn133	8	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:9.1	“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.	mn133	9	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:9.2	Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.	mn133	9	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:9.3	For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	mn133	9	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:9.4	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	mn133	9	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.1	“Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One.	mn133	10	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.2	That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.	mn133	10	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.3	We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.	mn133	10	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.4	Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.	mn133	10	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.5	He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn133	10	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:10.6	Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”	mn133	10	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:11.1	“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn133	11	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:11.2	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	mn133	11	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:11.3	Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:	mn133	11	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:12.1	“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:	mn133	12	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:12.2	‘Don’t run back to the past …	mn133	12	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:12.4	that’s who has one fine night—	mn133	12	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:12.5	so declares the peaceful sage.’	mn133	12	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:12.6	And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital.	mn133	12	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.1	And how do you run back to the past?	mn133	13	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.2	Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’	mn133	13	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.3	So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.	mn133	13	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.4	Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …	mn133	13	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.5	such a nose and such smells …	mn133	13	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.6	such a tongue and such tastes …	mn133	13	6	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.7	such a body and such touches …	mn133	13	7	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.8	such a mind and such ideas.’	mn133	13	8	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.9	So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.	mn133	13	9	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:13.10	That’s how you run back to the past.	mn133	13	10	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night

mn133:14.4	Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …	mn133	14	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night

mn133:19.1	This is how I understand the detailed meaning of that brief summary recital given by the Buddha.	mn133	19	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:19.7	If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.	mn133	19	7	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:19.8	You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”	mn133	19	8	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:20.1	Then those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said, rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:	mn133	20	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:20.31	“Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”	mn133	20	31	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:21.1	“Mahākaccāna is astute, mendicants, he has great wisdom.	mn133	21	1	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:21.2	If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.	mn133	21	2	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:21.3	That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”	mn133	21	3	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:21.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn133	21	4	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn133:21.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn133	21	5	mn	133	Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
mn134:1.1	So I have heard.	mn134	1	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn134	1	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.	mn134	1	3	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.1	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Candana, lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery, went up to the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya, and stood to one side. Standing to one side, he said to Lomasakaṅgiya:	mn134	2	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.2	“Mendicant, do you remember the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night?”	mn134	2	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.3	“No, reverend, I do not.	mn134	2	3	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.4	Do you?”	mn134	2	4	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.5	“I also do not.	mn134	2	5	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.6	But do you remember just the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	mn134	2	6	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.7	“I do not.	mn134	2	7	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.8	Do you?”	mn134	2	8	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.9	“I do.”	mn134	2	9	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.10	“How do you remember the verses on the one who has one fine night?”	mn134	2	10	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.11	“This one time, the Buddha was staying among the gods of the thirty-three at the root of the Shady Orchid Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug.	mn134	2	11	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:2.12	There he taught the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night to the gods of the thirty-three:	mn134	2	12	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.1	‘Don’t run back to the past,	mn134	3	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.2	don’t anticipate the future.	mn134	3	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.3	What’s past is left behind,	mn134	3	3	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.4	the future has not arrived;	mn134	3	4	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.5	and any present phenomenon	mn134	3	5	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night

mn134:3.7	The unfaltering, the unshakable:	mn134	3	7	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.8	having known that, foster it.	mn134	3	8	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night

mn134:3.10	who knows, tomorrow may bring death!	mn134	3	10	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.11	For there is no bargain to be struck	mn134	3	11	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.12	with Death and his mighty horde.	mn134	3	12	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.13	One who keenly meditates like this,	mn134	3	13	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.14	tireless all night and day:	mn134	3	14	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.15	that’s who has one fine night—	mn134	3	15	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:3.16	so declares the peaceful sage.’	mn134	3	16	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.1	That’s how I remember the verses of the one who has one fine night.	mn134	4	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.2	Learn the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night, mendicant,	mn134	4	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.3	memorize it,	mn134	4	3	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.4	and remember it.	mn134	4	4	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.5	It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”	mn134	4	5	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.6	That’s what the godling Candana said	mn134	4	6	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:4.7	before vanishing right there.	mn134	4	7	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:5.1	Then Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.	mn134	5	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:5.2	Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:	mn134	5	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:5.28	“Sir, please teach me the summary recital and the analysis of the one who has one fine night.”	mn134	5	28	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.1	“But mendicant, do you know that god?”	mn134	6	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.2	“I do not, sir.”	mn134	6	2	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.3	“That godling was named Candana.	mn134	6	3	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.4	Candana pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens to the teaching.	mn134	6	4	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.5	Well then, mendicant, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn134	6	5	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.6	“Yes, sir,” Lomasakaṅgiya replied.	mn134	6	6	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:6.7	The Buddha said this:	mn134	6	7	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:7.1	“Don’t run back to the past,	mn134	7	1	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night

mn134:14.17	That is what the Buddha said.	mn134	14	17	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn134:14.18	Satisfied, Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya approved what the Buddha said.	mn134	14	18	mn	134	Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
mn135:1.1	So I have heard.	mn135	1	1	mn	135	The Shorter Analysis of Deeds

mn135:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	mn135	2	2	mn	135	The Shorter Analysis of Deeds
mn135:3.1	“What is the cause, worthy Gotama, what is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superior?	mn135	3	1	mn	135	The Shorter Analysis of Deeds

mn135:5.1	“Take some woman or man who kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.	mn135	5	1	mn	135	The Shorter Analysis of Deeds

mn136:1.1	So I have heard.	mn136	1	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn136	1	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was staying in a wilderness hut.	mn136	2	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.2	Then as the wanderer Potaliputta was going for a walk he came up to Venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him.	mn136	2	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:	mn136	2	3	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.4	“Reverend Samiddhi, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic Gotama:	mn136	2	4	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.5	‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’	mn136	2	5	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.6	And: ‘There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.’”	mn136	2	6	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.7	“Don’t say that, Reverend Potaliputta, don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say this:	mn136	2	7	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.8	‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’	mn136	2	8	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.9	But, reverend, there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.”	mn136	2	9	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.10	“Reverend Samiddhi, how long has it been since you went forth?”	mn136	2	10	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.11	“Not long, reverend: three years.”	mn136	2	11	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.12	“Well now, what are we to say to the senior mendicants, when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defending?	mn136	2	12	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.13	After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, what does one feel?”	mn136	2	13	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.14	“After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, one feels suffering.”	mn136	2	14	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.15	Then, neither approving nor dismissing Samiddhi’s statement, Potaliputta	mn136	2	15	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:2.16	got up from his seat and left.	mn136	2	16	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.1	Soon after he had left, Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn136	3	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	mn136	3	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.3	and informed Ānanda of all they had discussed.	mn136	3	3	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.4	When he had spoken, Ānanda said to him,	mn136	3	4	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.5	“Reverend Samiddhi, we should see the Buddha about this matter.	mn136	3	5	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.6	Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.	mn136	3	6	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.7	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	mn136	3	7	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:3.8	“Yes, reverend,” Samiddhi replied.	mn136	3	8	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:4.1	Then Ānanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	mn136	4	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:4.2	and told him what had happened.	mn136	4	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:5.1	When they had spoken, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	mn136	5	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:5.2	“I don’t recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta, Ānanda, so how could we have had such a discussion?	mn136	5	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:5.3	The wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been answered after analyzing it, but this futile man answered categorically.”	mn136	5	3	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.1	When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,	mn136	6	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.2	“But perhaps, sir, Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statement:	mn136	6	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.3	‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’”	mn136	6	3	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.4	But the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn136	6	4	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.5	“See what this futile man Udāyī comes up with?	mn136	6	5	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.6	I knew that	mn136	6	6	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.7	he was coming up with something irrational.	mn136	6	7	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.8	Right from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelings.	mn136	6	8	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.9	Suppose the futile man Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputta’s question like this:	mn136	6	9	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.10	‘After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pleasure.	mn136	6	10	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.11	After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain.	mn136	6	11	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.12	After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels neutral.’	mn136	6	12	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.13	Answering in this way, Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta.	mn136	6	13	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.14	Still, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other religions to understand the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds?	mn136	6	14	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:6.15	If you would all listen, Ānanda, I will explain the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds.”	mn136	6	15	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:7.1	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!	mn136	7	1	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:7.2	Let the Buddha explain the great analysis of deeds. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn136	7	2	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:7.3	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn136	7	3	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds
mn136:7.4	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	mn136	7	4	mn	136	The Longer Analysis of Deeds

mn139:8.28	‘When the fetter of continued existence is given up, continued existence is also given up.’	mn139	8	28	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:8.30	That’s how there is neither flattering nor rebuking, and just teaching Dhamma.	mn139	8	30	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:8.31	‘Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.	mn139	8	31	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:8.32	Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.’	mn139	8	32	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:8.33	That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.	mn139	8	33	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.1	‘Know how to evaluate different kinds of pleasure.	mn139	9	1	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.2	Knowing this, pursue inner pleasure.’	mn139	9	2	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.3	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn139	9	3	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.4	There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn139	9	4	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.5	What five?	mn139	9	5	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.6	Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn139	9	6	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.7	Sounds known by the ear …	mn139	9	7	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.8	Smells known by the nose …	mn139	9	8	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.9	Tastes known by the tongue …	mn139	9	9	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.10	Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.	mn139	9	10	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.11	These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.	mn139	9	11	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.12	The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure—a filthy, common, ignoble pleasure.	mn139	9	12	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.13	Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed, but should be feared, I say.	mn139	9	13	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.14	Now, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.	mn139	9	14	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.15	As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …	mn139	9	15	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.16	third absorption …	mn139	9	16	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.17	fourth absorption.	mn139	9	17	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.18	This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening.	mn139	9	18	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:9.19	Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.	mn139	9	19	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:10.2	That’s what I said,	mn139	10	2	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:10.4	When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is untrue, false, and pointless, then to the best of your ability you should not speak.	mn139	10	4	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:10.5	When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is true and correct, but pointless, then you should train yourself not to speak.	mn139	10	5	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:10.6	When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is true, correct, and beneficial, then you should know the right time to speak.	mn139	10	6	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:10.7	When you know that your sharp words in someone’s presence are untrue, false, and pointless, then to the best of your ability you should not speak.	mn139	10	7	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:11.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn139	11	2	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:11.3	When speaking hurriedly, your body gets tired, your mind gets stressed, your voice gets stressed, your throat gets sore, and your words become unclear and hard to understand.	mn139	11	3	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:11.4	When not speaking hurriedly, your body doesn’t get tired, your mind doesn’t get stressed, your voice doesn’t get stressed, your throat doesn’t get sore, and your words are clear and easy to understand.	mn139	11	4	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:12.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn139	12	2	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:12.3	And how do you insist on popular terms and overstep normal labels?	mn139	12	3	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:12.4	It’s when among different populations they label the same thing as a ‘cup’, a ‘bowl’, a ‘jar’, a ‘scoop’, a ‘vessel’, a ‘dish’, or a ‘plate’.	mn139	12	4	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:12.5	And however it is known among those various populations, you speak accordingly, obstinately sticking to that and insisting:	mn139	12	5	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:12.6	‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’	mn139	12	6	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:12.7	That’s how you insist on popular terms and overstep normal labels.	mn139	12	7	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:13.1	Now, mendicants, indulging in the happiness of the pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.	mn139	13	1	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife

mn139:14.3	And, mendicants, the gentleman Subhūti practices the way free of strife.”	mn139	14	3	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:14.4	That is what the Buddha said.	mn139	14	4	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn139:14.5	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn139	14	5	mn	139	The Analysis of No Strife
mn140:1.1	So I have heard.	mn140	1	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the Magadhan lands when he arrived at Rājagaha.	mn140	1	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:1.3	He went to see Bhaggava the potter, and said,	mn140	1	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:2.1	“Bhaggava, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in your workshop.”	mn140	2	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:2.2	“It’s no trouble, sir.	mn140	2	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:2.3	But there’s a renunciate already staying there.	mn140	2	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:2.4	If he allows it, sir, you may stay as long as you please.”	mn140	2	4	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.1	Now at that time a gentleman named Pukkusāti had gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s name.	mn140	3	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.2	And it was he who had first taken up residence in the workshop.	mn140	3	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.3	Then the Buddha approached Venerable Pukkusāti and said,	mn140	3	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.4	“Mendicant, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in the workshop.”	mn140	3	4	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.5	“The potter’s workshop is spacious, reverend.	mn140	3	5	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:3.6	Stay as long as you please.”	mn140	3	6	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.1	Then the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side. He sat down cross-legged, set his body straight, and established mindfulness in his presence.	mn140	4	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.2	He spent much of the night sitting in meditation,	mn140	4	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.3	and so did Pukkusāti.	mn140	4	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.4	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn140	4	4	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.5	“This gentleman’s behavior is impressive.	mn140	4	5	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.6	Why don’t I question him?”	mn140	4	6	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:4.7	So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,	mn140	4	7	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.1	“In whose name have you gone forth, mendicant? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?”	mn140	5	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.2	“Reverend, there is the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.	mn140	5	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.3	He has this good reputation:	mn140	5	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn140	5	4	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.5	I’ve gone forth in his name.	mn140	5	5	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.6	That Blessed One is my Teacher,	mn140	5	6	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.7	and I believe in his teaching.”	mn140	5	7	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.8	“But mendicant, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	mn140	5	8	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.9	“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.	mn140	5	9	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.10	There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	mn140	5	10	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.11	“But have you ever seen that Buddha?	mn140	5	11	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.12	Would you recognize him if you saw him?”	mn140	5	12	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.13	“No, I’ve never seen him,	mn140	5	13	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:5.14	and I wouldn’t recognize him if I did.”	mn140	5	14	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	mn140	6	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.2	“This gentleman has gone forth in my name.	mn140	6	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.3	Why don’t I teach him the Dhamma?”	mn140	6	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.4	So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,	mn140	6	4	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.5	“Mendicant, I shall teach you the Dhamma.	mn140	6	5	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.6	Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn140	6	6	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.7	“Yes, reverend,” replied Pukkusāti.	mn140	6	7	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:6.8	The Buddha said this:	mn140	6	8	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:7.1	“‘This person has six elements, six fields of contact, eighteen mental preoccupations, and four foundations.	mn140	7	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:7.2	Where they stand, the streams of conceiving do not flow. And where the streams of conceiving do not flow, they are called a sage at peace.	mn140	7	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:7.3	Do not neglect wisdom; preserve truth; foster generosity; and train only for peace.’	mn140	7	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements

mn140:8.1	‘This person has six elements.’	mn140	8	1	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:8.2	That’s what I said, but why did I say it?	mn140	8	2	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements
mn140:8.3	There are these six elements:	mn140	8	3	mn	140	The Analysis of the Elements

mn142:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	mn142	3	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:3.2	“Sir, please accept the new pair of garments from Mahāpajāpati Gotamī.	mn142	3	2	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:3.8	It’s owing to the Buddha that she has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.	mn142	3	8	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:3.9	It’s owing to the Buddha that she is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.	mn142	3	9	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:3.10	The Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpati.”	mn142	3	10	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:6.1	Now, Ānanda, gifts to the following persons may be expected to yield the following returns. To an animal, a hundred times. To an unethical ordinary person, a thousand. To an ethical ordinary person, a hundred thousand. To an outsider free of desire for sensual pleasures, 10,000,000,000. But a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry may be expected to yield incalculable, immeasurable returns. How much more so a gift to a stream-enterer, someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return, a once-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return, a non-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection, a perfected one, or an independent Buddha? How much more so a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha?	mn142	6	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:8.1	In times to come there will be lambs of the flock wearing a scrap of ocher cloth, unethical and of bad character.	mn142	8	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:8.2	People will give gifts to those unethical people in the name of the Saṅgha.	mn142	8	2	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:8.3	Even then, I say, a religious donation bestowed on the Saṅgha is incalculable and immeasurable.	mn142	8	3	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:8.4	But I say that there is no way a personal offering can be more fruitful than one bestowed on a Saṅgha.	mn142	8	4	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:9.1	Ānanda, there are these four ways of purifying a religious donation.	mn142	9	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:9.3	There’s a religious donation that’s purified by the giver, not the recipient.	mn142	9	3	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:9.6	There’s a religious donation that’s purified by both the giver and the recipient.	mn142	9	6	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:10.1	And how is a religious donation purified by the giver, not the recipient?	mn142	10	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:10.2	It’s when the giver is ethical, of good character, but the recipient is unethical, of bad character.	mn142	10	2	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:11.1	And how is a religious donation purified by the recipient, not the giver?	mn142	11	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn142:14.1	That is what the Buddha said.	mn142	14	1	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:14.2	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	mn142	14	2	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations
mn142:14.3	“When an ethical person with trusting heart	mn142	14	3	mn	142	The Analysis of Religious Donations

mn143:1.1	So I have heard.	mn143	1	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn143	1	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:2.1	Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn143	2	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:2.2	Then he addressed a man,	mn143	2	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:2.3	“Please, worthy man, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	mn143	2	3	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika

mn143:2.5	He bows with his head to your feet.’	mn143	2	5	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:2.6	Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:	mn143	2	6	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika

mn143:2.19	Sāriputta consented with silence.	mn143	2	19	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:3.1	Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,	mn143	3	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:3.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	mn143	3	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:4.1	“I’m not keeping well, Honorable Sāriputta, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.	mn143	4	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:4.2	The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.	mn143	4	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:4.4	The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.	mn143	4	4	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:4.6	The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn143	4	6	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:4.8	The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. That’s how severe the burning is in my body.	mn143	4	8	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika

mn143:15.1	When he said this, Anāthapiṇḍika cried and burst out in tears.	mn143	15	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.2	Venerable Ānanda said to him,	mn143	15	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.3	“Are you failing, householder? Are you fading, householder?”	mn143	15	3	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.4	“No, Honorable Ānanda.	mn143	15	4	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.5	But for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicants.	mn143	15	5	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.6	Yet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talk.”	mn143	15	6	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.7	“Householder, such Dhamma talk does not strike when teaching white-clothed laypeople.	mn143	15	7	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.8	Rather, it strikes when teaching those gone forth.”	mn143	15	8	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.9	“Well then, Honorable Sāriputta, let such Dhamma talk strike when teaching white-clothed laypeople as well!	mn143	15	9	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.10	There are gentlemen with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.	mn143	15	10	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:15.11	There will be those who understand the teaching!”	mn143	15	11	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:16.1	And when the venerables Sāriputta and Ānanda had given the householder Anāthapiṇḍika this advice they got up from their seat and left.	mn143	16	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:16.2	Not long after they had left, Anāthapiṇḍika passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods.	mn143	16	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.1	Then, late at night, the glorious godling Anāthapiṇḍika, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,	mn143	17	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.2	and addressed the Buddha in verse:	mn143	17	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.3	“This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove,	mn143	17	3	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.4	frequented by the Saṅgha of seers,	mn143	17	4	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika

mn143:17.9	by these are mortals purified,	mn143	17	9	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.10	not by clan or wealth.	mn143	17	10	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.11	That’s why an astute person,	mn143	17	11	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.12	seeing what’s good for themselves,	mn143	17	12	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.13	would examine the teaching rationally,	mn143	17	13	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.14	and thus be purified in it.	mn143	17	14	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.15	Sāriputta is full of wisdom,	mn143	17	15	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.16	ethics, and peace.	mn143	17	16	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.17	Even a mendicant who has crossed over	mn143	17	17	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:17.18	might at best equal him.”	mn143	17	18	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:18.1	This is what the godling Anāthapiṇḍika said,	mn143	18	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:18.2	and the teacher approved.	mn143	18	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:18.3	Then the godling Anāthapiṇḍika,	mn143	18	3	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:18.4	knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.	mn143	18	4	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:19.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.	mn143	19	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.1	When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:	mn143	20	1	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.2	“Sir, that godling must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika.	mn143	20	2	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.3	For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta.”	mn143	20	3	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.4	“Good, good, Ānanda.	mn143	20	4	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.5	You’ve reached the logical conclusion, as far as logic goes.	mn143	20	5	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.6	For that was indeed the godling Anāthapiṇḍika.”	mn143	20	6	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.7	That is what the Buddha said.	mn143	20	7	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn143:20.8	Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.	mn143	20	8	mn	143	Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
mn144:1.1	So I have heard.	mn144	1	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn144	1	2	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:2.1	Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	mn144	2	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:3.1	Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	mn144	3	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:3.2	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him,	mn144	3	2	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:3.3	“Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.”	mn144	3	3	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:3.4	“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.	mn144	3	4	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:4.1	And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with him.	mn144	4	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:4.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Then Sāriputta said to Channa,	mn144	4	2	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:4.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re all right. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”	mn144	4	3	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:5.1	“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.	mn144	5	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn144:5.6	The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a sharp meat cleaver.	mn144	5	6	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:5.8	The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.	mn144	5	8	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:5.9	I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.	mn144	5	9	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:5.10	Reverend Sāriputta, I will commit suicide. I don’t wish to live.”	mn144	5	10	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:6.1	“Please don’t commit suicide!	mn144	6	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn144:7.4	Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.	mn144	7	4	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn144:10.1	“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?”	mn144	10	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:10.7	“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”	mn144	10	7	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:11.1	When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa:	mn144	11	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:11.2	“So, Reverend Channa, you should regularly apply your mind to this instruction of the Buddha:	mn144	11	2	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:11.3	‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.	mn144	11	3	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn144:11.8	When there’s no passing away and reappearing there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two.	mn144	11	8	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:11.9	Just this is the end of suffering.’”	mn144	11	9	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:11.10	And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.	mn144	11	10	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:12.1	Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa committed suicide.	mn144	12	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.1	Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn144	13	1	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.2	“Sir, Venerable Channa has committed suicide.	mn144	13	2	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn144:13.7	“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families.	mn144	13	7	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.8	But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’.	mn144	13	8	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.9	When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’.	mn144	13	9	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.10	But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.	mn144	13	10	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.11	You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa committed suicide blamelessly.’”	mn144	13	11	mn	144	Advice to Channa
mn144:13.12	That is what the Buddha said.	mn144	13	12	mn	144	Advice to Channa

mn145:1.1	So I have heard.	mn145	1	1	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn145	1	2	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Puṇṇa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,	mn145	1	3	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:2.1	“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”	mn145	2	1	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa

mn145:6.3	Now, Puṇṇa, go at your convenience.”	mn145	6	3	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:7.1	And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddha’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sunāparanta.	mn145	7	1	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sunāparanta,	mn145	7	2	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa

mn145:7.4	Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers. And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges.	mn145	7	4	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:7.5	Some time later he became fully extinguished.	mn145	7	5	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	mn145	8	1	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.2	“Sir, the gentleman named Puṇṇa, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.	mn145	8	2	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.3	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	mn145	8	3	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.4	“Mendicants, Puṇṇa was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	mn145	8	4	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.5	Puṇṇa has become fully quenched.”	mn145	8	5	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn145	8	6	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn145:8.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn145	8	7	mn	145	Advice to Puṇṇa
mn146:1.1	So I have heard.	mn146	1	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	mn146	1	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:2.1	Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	mn146	2	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:2.2	“Sir, may the Buddha please advise	mn146	2	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:2.3	and instruct the nuns.	mn146	2	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:2.4	Please give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”	mn146	2	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.1	Now at that time the senior monks were taking turns to advise the nuns.	mn146	3	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.2	But Venerable Nandaka didn’t want to take his turn.	mn146	3	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.3	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	mn146	3	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.4	“Ānanda, whose turn is it to advise the nuns today?”	mn146	3	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.5	“It’s Nandaka’s turn, sir,	mn146	3	5	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:3.6	but he doesn’t want to do it.”	mn146	3	6	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.1	Then the Buddha said to Nandaka,	mn146	4	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:4.4	Please, brahmin, give the nuns a Dhamma talk.”	mn146	4	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.5	“Yes, sir,” replied Nandaka. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn146	4	5	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.6	He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Royal Monastery with a companion.	mn146	4	6	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.7	Those nuns saw him coming off in the distance,	mn146	4	7	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.8	so they spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.	mn146	4	8	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.9	Nandaka sat down on the seat spread out,	mn146	4	9	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.10	and washed his feet.	mn146	4	10	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.11	Those nuns bowed, and sat down to one side.	mn146	4	11	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:4.12	Nandaka said to them,	mn146	4	12	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:5.1	“Sisters, this talk shall be in the form of questions.	mn146	5	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:5.3	If anyone has a doubt or uncertainty, ask me about it:	mn146	5	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:13.2	What seven?	mn146	13	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:13.3	It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,	mn146	13	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:14.2	“Go, sisters, it is time.”	mn146	14	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:14.3	And then those nuns approved and agreed with what Nandaka had said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. The Buddha said to them,	mn146	14	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:14.4	“Go, nuns, it is time.”	mn146	14	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:14.5	Then those nuns bowed to the Buddha respectfully circled him, keeping him on their right, before departing.	mn146	14	5	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:15.1	Soon after those nuns had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:	mn146	15	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:15.2	“Suppose, mendicants, it was the sabbath of the fourteenth day. You wouldn’t get lots of people	mn146	15	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:15.4	In the same way, those nuns were uplifted by Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching, but they still haven’t got all they wished for.”	mn146	15	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:16.1	Then the Buddha said to Nandaka,	mn146	16	1	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:16.2	“Well then, Nandaka, tomorrow you should give those nuns the same advice again.”	mn146	16	2	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:16.3	“Yes, sir,” Nandaka replied.	mn146	16	3	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:16.4	And the next day he went to those nuns, and all unfolded just like the previous day.	mn146	16	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn146:27.4	In the same way, those nuns were uplifted by Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching, and they got all they wished for.	mn146	27	4	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:27.5	Even the last of these five hundred nuns is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	mn146	27	5	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:27.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn146	27	6	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka
mn146:27.7	Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said.	mn146	27	7	mn	146	Advice from Nandaka

mn147:1.5	Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”	mn147	1	5	mn	147	The Shorter Advice to Rāhula
mn147:1.6	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	mn147	1	6	mn	147	The Shorter Advice to Rāhula
mn147:1.7	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Rāhula,	mn147	1	7	mn	147	The Shorter Advice to Rāhula
mn147:1.8	“Rāhula, get your sitting cloth.	mn147	1	8	mn	147	The Shorter Advice to Rāhula

mn150:1.1	So I have heard.	mn150	1	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda.	mn150	1	2	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.1	The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard,	mn150	2	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.2	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	mn150	2	2	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.3	He has this good reputation:	mn150	2	3	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	mn150	2	4	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.5	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	mn150	2	5	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.6	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	mn150	2	6	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:2.7	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	mn150	2	7	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:3.1	Then the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. The Buddha said to them:	mn150	3	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:4.1	“Householders, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you:	mn150	4	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda

mn150:4.5	Why is that?	mn150	4	5	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda

mn150:5.8	There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear …	mn150	5	8	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda

mn150:5.12	ideas known by the mind, who are peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves well by way of body, speech, and mind. They deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.	mn150	5	12	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:5.13	Why is that?	mn150	5	13	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:5.14	Because we ourselves are not free of these things, but we see that they have a higher good conduct than us.	mn150	5	14	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:5.15	That’s why they deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.	mn150	5	15	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:5.16	When questioned by wanderers of other religions, that’s how you should answer them.	mn150	5	16	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.1	If wanderers of other religions were to ask you:	mn150	6	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.2	‘But what reasons and evidence do you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,	mn150	6	2	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.3	“Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”?’	mn150	6	3	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.4	You should answer them:	mn150	6	4	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.5	‘It’s because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.	mn150	6	5	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.6	In such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy, there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy, no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy, no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy, and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoy.	mn150	6	6	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.7	These are the reasons and evidence that you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,	mn150	6	7	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.8	“Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”.’	mn150	6	8	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:6.9	When questioned by wanderers of other religions, that’s how you should answer them.”	mn150	6	9	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:7.1	When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda said to the Buddha,	mn150	7	1	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:7.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	mn150	7	2	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:7.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.	mn150	7	3	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:7.4	We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	mn150	7	4	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn150:7.5	From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”	mn150	7	5	mn	150	With the People of Nagaravinda
mn151:1.1	So I have heard.	mn151	1	1	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	mn151	1	2	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn151	1	3	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.1	“Sāriputta, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.	mn151	2	1	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.2	What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?”	mn151	2	2	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.3	“Sir, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.”	mn151	2	3	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.4	“Good, good, Sāriputta!	mn151	2	4	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.5	It seems you usually practice the meditation of a great man.	mn151	2	5	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:2.6	For emptiness is the meditation of a great man.	mn151	2	6	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:3.1	Now, a mendicant might wish:	mn151	3	1	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:3.2	‘May I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’ So they should reflect:	mn151	3	2	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:3.3	‘Along the path that I went for alms, or in the place I wandered for alms, or along the path that I returned from alms, was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sights known by the eye?’	mn151	3	3	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:3.4	Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that	mn151	3	4	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:3.5	there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart, they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities.	mn151	3	5	mn	151	The Purification of Alms

mn151:21.1	Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who purify their almsfood do so by continually checking in this way.	mn151	21	1	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:21.4	So, Sāriputta, you should all train like this: ‘We shall purify our almsfood by continually checking.’”	mn151	21	4	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:21.6	That is what the Buddha said.	mn151	21	6	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn151:21.7	Satisfied, Venerable Sāriputta approved what the Buddha said.	mn151	21	7	mn	151	The Purification of Alms
mn152:1.1	So I have heard.	mn152	1	1	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove.	mn152	1	2	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.1	Then the student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	mn152	2	1	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,	mn152	2	2	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.3	“Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?”	mn152	2	3	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.4	“He does, worthy Gotama.”	mn152	2	4	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.5	“But how does he teach it?”	mn152	2	5	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.6	“Worthy Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound.	mn152	2	6	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.7	That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.”	mn152	2	7	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.8	“In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties	mn152	2	8	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.9	according to what Pārāsariya says.	mn152	2	9	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.10	For a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the ear.”	mn152	2	10	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:2.11	When he said this, Uttara sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.	mn152	2	11	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.1	Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda,	mn152	3	1	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.2	“Ānanda, the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.”	mn152	3	2	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.3	“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One.	mn152	3	3	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.4	Let the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”	mn152	3	4	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.5	“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”	mn152	3	5	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.6	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	mn152	3	6	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:3.7	The Buddha said this:	mn152	3	7	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:4.1	“And how, Ānanda, is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One?	mn152	4	1	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
mn152:4.2	When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, in them arises what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, and what is both agreeable and disagreeable.	mn152	4	2	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties

mn152:4.12	In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sights known by the eye.	mn152	4	12	mn	152	The Development of the Faculties
