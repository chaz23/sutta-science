cp1:0.4	Akitti’s Conduct	NA
cp1:1.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
cp1:2.1	“For a hundred thousand eons	NA
cp1:2.2	and four incalculable ages,	NA
cp1:2.3	all my conduct in that period	NA
cp1:2.4	ripens in awakening.	NA
cp1:3.1	Setting aside my conduct	NA
cp1:3.2	in past eons through different lives,	NA
cp1:3.3	I shall speak of my conduct	NA
cp1:3.4	in this eon, hear me.	NA
cp1:4.1	When I lived having plunged	NA
cp1:4.2	into the formidable jungle	NA
cp1:4.3	of empty thickets and glades,	NA
cp1:4.4	my name was Akitti the mortifier.	NA
cp1:5.1	Then, burned by the fires of my mortification,	NA
cp1:5.2	the sovereign of the Third Heaven,	Namely Sakka AKA Indra.
cp1:5.3	came to me for alms	NA
cp1:5.4	in the form of a brahmin.	NA
cp1:6.1	I had gathered leaves from the forest	NA
cp1:6.2	without oil or salt,	NA
cp1:6.3	and seeing him standing at my door,	NA
cp1:6.4	I placed them in his pot.	NA
cp1:7.1	After giving him the leaves	NA
cp1:7.2	I turned over my plate,	NA
cp1:7.3	and having given up on seeking more food,	NA
cp1:7.4	I entered my hut of leaves.	NA
cp1:8.1	A second and a third time	NA
cp1:8.2	he came to me.	NA
cp1:8.3	Undisturbed, ungrasping,	NA
cp1:8.4	I gave in just the same way.	NA
cp1:9.1	That is the reason why	NA
cp1:9.2	my body is not discolored.	NA
cp1:9.3	In rapture and bliss free of relishing	NA
cp1:9.4	I spend the day.	NA
cp1:10.1	If even for a month or two	NA
cp1:10.2	I were to find a worthy recipient,	NA
cp1:10.3	undisturbed, unattached,	NA
cp1:10.4	I would give the supreme gift.	NA
cp1:11.1	While giving him that gift	NA
cp1:11.2	I did not wish for fame or profit.	NA
cp1:11.3	Wishing for omniscience	NA
cp1:11.4	I performed those deeds.”	NA

cp2:1.1	“Then again when I was	NA
cp2:1.2	a brahmin called Saṅkha,	NA
cp2:1.3	wanting to cross the great ocean,	NA
cp2:1.4	I was on my way to the port.	NA
cp2:2.1	There I saw across the way	NA
cp2:2.2	one self-awakened, undefeated,	NA
cp2:2.3	walking a desert road	NA
cp2:2.4	whose ground was hot and rough.	NA
cp2:3.1	Seeing him across the way,	NA
cp2:3.2	I thought this:	NA
cp2:3.3	‘A field has appeared	NA
cp2:3.4	for a person desiring merit.	NA
cp2:4.1	Now suppose a farmer	NA
cp2:4.2	seeing a fertile field	NA
cp2:4.3	does not sow seed there,	NA
cp2:4.4	then they are not in need of grain.	NA
cp2:5.1	So too, if I, desiring merit,	NA
cp2:5.2	seeing a supreme excellent field,	NA
cp2:5.3	do not render service there,	NA
cp2:5.4	then I am not in need of merit.	NA
cp2:6.1	Or suppose a minister seeking the royal seal	NA
cp2:6.2	of authority over the people of the court,	NA
cp2:6.3	does not give them money and grain,	NA
cp2:6.4	their authority dwindles.	NA
cp2:7.1	So too, if I, desiring merit,	NA
cp2:7.2	seeing an abundantly worthy recipient,	NA
cp2:7.3	do not give gifts to them,	NA
cp2:7.4	I will dwindle in merit.’	NA
cp2:8.1	Reflecting in this way,	NA
cp2:8.2	I took off my sandals	NA
cp2:8.3	and bowed to his feet,	NA
cp2:8.4	giving him an umbrella and sandals.	NA
cp2:9.1	Though I was a hundred times	NA
cp2:9.2	more delicate and dainty than him,	NA
cp2:9.3	fulfilling my generosity,	NA
cp2:9.4	I gave like this to him.”	NA

cp3:1.2	in Indapatta, the capital city,	Indrapastha, modern Delhi.
cp3:1.3	as the king named Dhanañjaya	NA
cp3:1.4	I was blessed with the ten skillful deeds.	NA
cp3:2.1	From the realm of Kaliṅga	NA
cp3:2.2	brahmins came to me	NA
cp3:2.3	requesting the royal elephant	NA
cp3:2.4	that was lucky and deemed auspicious.	NA
cp3:3.1	‘Our nation is suffering from drought,	NA

cp3:5.1	Taking the elephant by the trunk,	NA
cp3:5.2	and a bejeweled ceremonial vessel,	NA
cp3:5.3	I sprinkled water on the hand,	NA
cp3:5.4	and gave the elephant to the brahmins.	NA
cp3:6.1	When I had given the elephant,	NA
cp3:6.2	my ministers said,	NA
cp3:6.3	‘Why did you give the noble elephant	NA
cp3:6.4	to the supplicants?	NA
cp3:7.1	He was lucky and endowed with the auspicious,	NA
cp3:7.2	supreme victor in battle.	NA
cp3:7.3	Now you have given the elephant,	NA
cp3:7.4	how shall you govern the realm?’	NA
cp3:8.1	‘I would give the entire realm	NA
cp3:8.2	and my physical body as well.	NA
cp3:8.3	Omniscience is precious to me,	NA
cp3:8.4	which is why I gave away the elephant.’”	NA

cp4:1.1	“In the city of Kusāvatī,	NA
cp4:1.2	when I was Lord of the Earth,	NA
cp4:1.3	my name was Sudassana the Great,	NA
cp4:1.4	a wheel-turning monarch of great power.	NA
cp4:2.1	There, thrice a day,	NA
cp4:2.2	I declared in one place or another:	NA
cp4:2.3	‘Who needs what? Who wants what?	NA
cp4:2.4	To whom ought riches be given?	NA
cp4:3.1	Who needs an umbrella? Who is thirsty?	NA
cp4:3.2	Who a garland? Who some makeup?	NA
cp4:3.3	What person, being naked,	NA
cp4:3.4	and will put on colorful clothes?	NA
cp4:4.1	Who will take an umbrella on a highway,	NA
cp4:4.2	who needs sandals, soft and pretty?’	NA
cp4:4.3	Thus I had it proclaimed everywhere	NA
cp4:4.4	morning and night.	NA
cp4:5.1	It was not just in ten places,	NA
cp4:5.2	or even a hundred,	NA
cp4:5.3	but in many hundreds of places	NA
cp4:5.4	riches were prepared for supplicants.	NA
cp4:6.1	By day or by night	NA
cp4:6.2	if a supplicant comes,	NA
cp4:6.3	then having gotten all he wants,	NA
cp4:6.4	he leaves with full hands.	NA
cp4:7.1	I gave great gifts like this	NA
cp4:7.2	for my whole life.	NA
cp4:7.3	I did not give because I disliked riches,	NA
cp4:7.4	or because I had a store set aside.	NA
cp4:8.1	Suppose a person is sick.	NA
cp4:8.2	In order to be free of sickness	NA
cp4:8.3	having compensated the doctor with money,	NA
cp4:8.4	they become freed from sickness.	NA
cp4:9.1	Thus I, knowingly,	NA
cp4:9.2	in order to fulfill without remainder,	NA
cp4:9.3	to fulfill what is lacking,	NA
cp4:9.4	gave gifts to supplicants	NA
cp4:9.5	without clinging or reward,	NA

cp5:2.2	what I receieved as tribute	NA
cp5:2.3	I used to give a great gift	NA

cp5:3.1	It was not because I disliked riches or grain,	NA

cp6:3.1	Clothing and beds,	NA
cp6:3.2	food and drink to enjoy:	NA
cp6:3.3	I provided them without let,	NA

cp7:3.1	I did not drink, I did not eat,	NA

cp7:5.3	That is why what is to be given to others	NA

cp7:6.1	Knowing the reason for this,	NA

cp8:0.4	King Sivi’s Conduct	NA
cp8:1.1	“In the city called Ariṭṭha	NA
cp8:1.2	I was the aristocrat named Sivi.	NA
cp8:1.3	Seated in my finest longhouse,	NA
cp8:1.4	I then had the following thought:	NA
cp8:2.1	‘Whatever human gifts there are,	NA
cp8:2.2	none may be found that I have not given.	NA
cp8:2.3	Even if someone were to ask for my eye,	NA
cp8:2.4	I would give it without wavering.’	NA
cp8:3.1	Knowing my thoughts,	NA
cp8:3.2	Sakka the lord of gods,	NA
cp8:3.3	sitting in the assembly of gods	NA
cp8:3.4	said the following.	NA
cp8:4.1	‘Seated in his finest longhouse,	NA
cp8:4.2	the mighty King Sivi	NA
cp8:4.3	is thinking of manifold gifts	NA
cp8:4.4	and cannot see any he would not give.	NA
cp8:5.1	Is this is true or not?	NA
cp8:5.2	Come, let us test him.	NA
cp8:5.3	Wait a while	NA
cp8:5.4	until I know his mind.’	NA
cp8:6.1	Appearing as a frail old man,	NA
cp8:6.2	with grey hair and wrinkled skin,	NA
cp8:6.3	feeble and blind,	NA
cp8:6.4	he approached the king.	NA
cp8:7.1	Then, stretching out	NA
cp8:7.2	his left and right arms,	NA
cp8:7.3	he raised his joined palms to his head	NA
cp8:7.4	and said the following.	NA
cp8:8.1	‘Great king, I have a request for you.	NA
cp8:8.2	Under your just rule the kingdom has flourished,	NA
cp8:8.3	and the renown of your love of giving	NA
cp8:8.4	has risen among gods and humans.	NA
cp8:9.1	Both my eyes, by which I find my way,	NA
cp8:9.2	are ruined and become blind.	NA
cp8:9.3	Give me just one eye,	NA
cp8:9.4	while you too get by with one.’	NA
cp8:10.1	After hearing his words	NA
cp8:10.2	I was thrilled, my mind elated,	NA
cp8:10.3	so with joined palms, inspired,	NA
cp8:10.4	I said the following.	NA
cp8:11.1	‘Just now I was reflecting on this	NA
cp8:11.2	when I came here from the longhouse.	NA
cp8:11.3	Understanding my mind,	NA
cp8:11.4	you have come to ask for an eye.	NA
cp8:12.1	Oh! My wish has come true!	NA
cp8:12.2	My intention is fulfilled!	NA
cp8:12.3	Today I shall give to a supplicant	NA
cp8:12.4	a fine gift never before given.’	NA
cp8:13.1	‘Come Sivaka, stand up,	Commentary says these two verses were spoken by the king’s minister.
cp8:13.2	do not hesitate or waver.	NA
cp8:13.3	Pluck out even both eyes	NA
cp8:13.4	and give them to the supplicant.’	NA
cp8:14.1	And then, urged on by me,	NA
cp8:14.2	Sivaka did as I said.	NA
cp8:14.3	Extracting both eyes,	NA
cp8:14.4	he presented them to the trembling supplicant.	NA
cp8:15.1	‘While planning to give, while giving,	Both _dadamāna_ and _denta_ are present participles, but the commentary explains _dadamāna_ as infinitive (_dātuṁ_).
cp8:15.2	and after I had given,	NA
cp8:15.3	my mind did not falter,	NA
cp8:15.4	because it was solely for awakening.	NA
cp8:16.1	It was not because I disliked my eyes,	NA
cp8:16.2	or that I disliked myself,	NA
cp8:16.3	but because omniscience is precious to me,	NA
cp8:16.4	that is why I gave away my eyes.’”	NA

cp9:0.4	Vessantara’s Conduct	NA
cp9:1.1	“She who was my mother,	NA
cp9:1.2	the aristocrat lady named Phussatī,	NA
cp9:1.3	was Sakka’s beloved queen	NA
cp9:1.4	in past lives.	NA
cp9:2.1	Knowing that she was at the end of life,	NA
cp9:2.2	the lord of gods said this:	NA
cp9:2.3	‘I grant you ten favors,	NA
cp9:2.4	my dear, whatever favor you wish.’	NA
cp9:3.1	When he said this the queen	NA
cp9:3.2	replied to Sakka:	NA
cp9:3.3	‘In what way am I deficient?	NA
cp9:3.4	How am I displeasing to you?	NA
cp9:3.5	You send me from this lovely place,	NA
cp9:3.6	like the wind a feeble tree.’	NA
cp9:4.1	When she said this Sakka	NA
cp9:4.2	replied to her:	NA
cp9:4.3	‘You have done nothing wrong,	NA
cp9:4.4	nor are you not beloved to me.	NA
cp9:5.1	But your life lasts only so long,	NA
cp9:5.2	your time of death will come.	NA
cp9:5.3	Accept the ten supreme favors	NA
cp9:5.4	I offer to you.’	NA
cp9:6.1	She accepted the offerings of Sakka,	NA
cp9:6.2	full of joy and happiness.	NA
cp9:6.3	Having conceived me,	NA
cp9:6.4	Phussatī was blessed with the ten favors.	NA
cp9:7.1	Then Phussatī, having passed from there,	NA
cp9:7.2	was reborn as an aristocrat	NA
cp9:7.3	in the city of Jetuttara,	NA
cp9:7.4	where she married Sañjaya.	NA
cp9:8.1	Once I was conceived in the womb	NA
cp9:8.2	of my dear mother Phussatī,	NA
cp9:8.3	because of my power,	NA
cp9:8.4	my mother always delighted in giving.	NA
cp9:9.1	She gave to the destitute, the ailing and aging,	NA
cp9:9.2	to beggars, travelers, and folk,	NA
cp9:9.3	to ascetics and brahmins, and the dispossessed,	NA
cp9:9.4	and to those who had nothing.	NA
cp9:10.1	Having carried me for ten months,	NA
cp9:10.2	she was proceeding around the city	NA
cp9:10.3	when Phussatī gave birth to me	NA
cp9:10.4	in the middle of the peasant’s street.	NA
cp9:11.1	My name was not from my mother’s side,	NA
cp9:11.2	nor from my father’s.	NA
cp9:11.3	I was born there in the peasant’s street,	NA
cp9:11.4	and that’s why I’m called Vessantara.	NA
cp9:12.1	When I was a boy	NA
cp9:12.2	of only eight years old,	NA
cp9:12.3	sitting in the stilt longhouse,	NA
cp9:12.4	I thought of giving gifts.	NA
cp9:13.1	‘I would give my heart and my eyes,	NA
cp9:13.2	my flesh and blood too.’	NA
cp9:13.3	I announced that I would give my body,	NA
cp9:13.4	if anyone asked me.	NA
cp9:14.1	Reflecting on my state of mind,	NA
cp9:14.2	so undisturbed and steadfast,	NA
cp9:14.3	the earth quaked there,	NA
cp9:14.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	NA
cp9:15.1	Every fortnight, the fifteenth,	NA
cp9:15.2	and the sabbath when the moon was full,	NA
cp9:15.3	I mounted the tusker Paccaya	NA
cp9:15.4	and went to give gifts.	NA
cp9:16.1	From the country of Kaliṅga,	NA
cp9:16.2	the brahmins came to me,	NA
cp9:16.3	requesting the royal elephant,	NA
cp9:16.4	that was lucky and deemed as auspicious.	NA
cp9:17.1	‘Our nation is suffering from drought,	NA
cp9:17.2	food is scarce and famine abounds,	NA
cp9:17.3	please give the noble elephant	NA
cp9:17.4	the all-white supreme elephant.’	NA
cp9:18.1	‘I give without hesitation	NA
cp9:18.2	what you ask of me, brahmins.	NA
cp9:18.3	I do not hide what I have,	NA
cp9:18.4	for my heart is happy to give.	NA
cp9:19.1	When supplicants come to me	NA
cp9:19.2	it is unbefitting to refuse.	NA
cp9:19.3	Let not my vow be broken,	NA
cp9:19.4	I shall give the mighty elephant.’	NA
cp9:20.1	Taking the elephant by the trunk,	NA
cp9:20.2	and a bejeweled ceremonial vessel,	NA
cp9:20.3	I sprinkled water on the hand,	NA
cp9:20.4	and gave the elephant to the brahmins.	NA
cp9:21.1	Then again when I was giving	NA
cp9:21.2	the all-white supreme elephant,	NA
cp9:21.3	the earth quaked again,	NA
cp9:21.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	NA
cp9:22.1	At the gift of the tusker,	NA
cp9:22.2	angry townsfolk gathered	NA
cp9:22.3	and banished me from my kingdom, saying:	NA
cp9:22.4	‘Go to Crooked Mountain.’	NA
cp9:23.1	While they were ejecting me,	NA
cp9:23.2	I was undisturbed and steadfast,	NA
cp9:23.3	I asked one favor:	NA
cp9:23.4	to perform a great offering.	NA
cp9:24.1	When I asked, all the townsfolk	NA
cp9:24.2	granted me that one favor.	NA
cp9:24.3	Sounding the drums,	NA
cp9:24.4	I gave a great offering.	NA
cp9:25.1	And as the sound went forth,	NA
cp9:25.2	there was a great tumult and upset.	NA
cp9:25.3	They drove me out because of giving,	NA
cp9:25.4	but I just gave again.	NA
cp9:26.1	Elephants, horses, chariots,	NA
cp9:26.2	male and female slaves, cattle, and riches:	NA
cp9:26.3	after giving this great gift	NA
cp9:26.4	I then left the city.	NA
cp9:27.1	After leaving the city,	NA
cp9:27.2	I turned back to look,	NA
cp9:27.3	at which the earth quaked,	NA
cp9:27.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	NA
cp9:28.1	Having given away my four-horse chariot,	NA
cp9:28.2	I was standing at the crossroads	NA
cp9:28.3	alone with no partner,	NA
cp9:28.4	and I said to Queen Maddī:	NA
cp9:29.1	‘Maddī, you take Kaṇhā,	NA
cp9:29.2	for she, as the younger sister, is the lighter.	NA
cp9:29.3	I shall take Jāli,	NA
cp9:29.4	for he, as the brother, is heavier.’	NA
cp9:30.1	Like a pink or white lotus,	NA
cp9:30.2	Maddī picked up Kaṇhājinā.	NA
cp9:30.3	Like a golden statue,	NA
cp9:30.4	I picked up Jāli, the aristocrat.	NA
cp9:31.1	High-born and delicate,	NA
cp9:31.2	four aristocrat folk	NA
cp9:31.3	traveled ground even and uneven,	NA
cp9:31.4	going to Crooked Mountain.	NA
cp9:32.1	Whenever men would come along,	NA
cp9:32.2	coming the other way along the road,	NA
cp9:32.3	we asked them in the middle of the street,	NA
cp9:32.4	‘Where is Crooked Mountain?’	NA
cp9:33.1	Seeing us there,	NA
cp9:33.2	they spoke to us kindly,	NA
cp9:33.3	‘It will be hard for you,’ they explained,	NA
cp9:33.4	‘for Crooked Mountain is far.’	NA
cp9:34.1	If the children saw fruit	NA
cp9:34.2	on a tree in the forest,	NA

cp9:38.1	Native spirits, out of compassion,	NA

cp9:38.3	so that on the very day they set out,	NA
cp9:38.4	they arrived at the kingdom of Ceta.	NA
cp9:39.1	Sixty thousand kings	NA

cp9:43.1	Having plunged into the forest,	NA
cp9:43.2	quiet and undisturbed,	NA
cp9:43.3	we four people	NA

cp9:44.4	lived then in that hermitage.	NA
cp9:45.1	While caring for the children,	NA
cp9:45.2	I was not idle in the hermitage.	NA
cp9:45.3	Maddī gathered fruit,	NA
cp9:45.4	and provided for three people.	NA
cp9:46.1	While I was living in the forest,	NA
cp9:46.2	a traveler came to me	NA
cp9:46.3	and asked for my children,	NA

cp9:49.2	in the guise of a brahmin.	NA
cp9:49.3	He asked me for Queen Maddī,	NA
cp9:49.4	virtuous, and devoted.	NA
cp9:50.1	Taking Maddī by the hand,	NA
cp9:50.2	filling clasped hands with water,	NA
cp9:50.3	with a confident heart,	NA
cp9:50.4	I gave Maddī to him.	NA
cp9:51.1	As Maddī was being given,	NA
cp9:51.2	gods applauded in the welkin,	NA

cp9:54.3	Crying pitifully,	NA
cp9:54.4	they spoke of my happiness and sadness.	NA
cp9:55.1	With deep conscience and prudence,	NA
cp9:55.2	I approached them,	NA
cp9:55.3	at which the earth quaked,	NA
cp9:55.4	and Mount Sineru, wreathed in forests.	NA
cp9:56.1	Later on in the mighty forest,	NA

dhp44:0.3	4. Flowers	NA
dhp44:1	Who bestirs this earth,	The verbs _vicessati_ and _pacessati_ in this verse appear to be unique. I take them to be from the Sanskrit _ceṣṭ_ (“move, explore”) rather than _ci_ (“gather”). They can then be read as present tense, which makes better sense of the verse. Sanskrit and Gandhari parallels have a variety of forms, all of which maintain the distinction between the _vi_ and _pa_ prefixes. | I take _vicessati_ in the sense “stir, agitate”, with reference to such passages as [an7.69:15.1](), where the noble one inspires the gods. The commentary, rather, suggests the sense “explore, investigate”. A variant reading _vijessati_ yields the sense “shall conquer”.
dhp44:2	and the Yama realm with its gods?	NA
dhp44:3	Who sets out the well-taught word of truth,	The verb _pacessati_ is exceedingly rare, but the late tantric text Sarvatathāgatādhiṣṭhāna Vyūhasūtra has _praceṣṭavyaḥ_, evidently in the sense of “setting out” scents, flowers, etc. on a shrine. Compare the sense of “having prepared” (the offering for the fire, _ceṣṭitvā_) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.19.

iti22:2.4	Having developed a mind of love for seven years, for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn’t return to this world again.	NA

iti27:2.2	Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.	NA
iti27:3.1	It’s like how the radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance. Surpassing them, the moon’s radiance shines and glows and radiates.	NA
iti27:3.2	In the same way, of all the grounds for making worldly merit, none are worth a sixteenth part of the heart’s release by love. Surpassing them, the heart’s release by love shines and glows and radiates.	NA

iti30:2.4	Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I have done bad things’, they’re mortified.	NA

iti38:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti38:2.1	“Two thoughts, mendicants, often occur to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:	NA
iti38:2.2	the thought of sanctuary, and that of seclusion.	NA
iti38:2.3	The Realized One loves kindness and delights in it,	NA
iti38:2.4	so this thought often occurs to him:	NA
iti38:2.5	‘Through this behavior, I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail.’	NA
iti38:3.1	The Realized One loves seclusion and delights in it,	NA
iti38:3.2	so this thought often occurs to him:	NA
iti38:3.3	‘What is unskillful has been given up.’	NA
iti38:4.1	So, mendicants, you too should love kindness and delight in it,	NA
iti38:4.2	then this thought will often occur to you:	NA
iti38:4.3	‘Through this behavior, I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail.’	NA
iti38:5.1	You too should love seclusion and delight in it,	NA
iti38:5.2	then this thought will often occur to you:	NA
iti38:5.3	‘What is unskillful? What is not given up? What should I give up?’”	NA
iti38:5.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti38:5.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti38:6.1	“Two thoughts occur to him,	NA
iti38:6.2	the Realized One, the bearer of the unbearable:	NA
iti38:6.3	first mentioned was thought of sanctuary,	NA
iti38:6.4	then the second made clear was seclusion.	NA
iti38:7.1	Dispeller of darkness, the great seer has crossed over:	NA
iti38:7.2	the attained, the master, the undefiled.	NA
iti38:7.3	In the midst of it all, <j>he is freed in the ending of craving;	NA
iti38:7.4	that sage bears his final body.	NA
iti38:7.5	He has disposed of Māra, I declare, <j>and gone beyond old age.	NA
iti38:8.1	Standing high on a rocky mountain,	NA
iti38:8.2	you can see the people all around.	NA
iti38:8.3	In just the same way, the all-seer, so intelligent,	NA
iti38:8.4	having ascended the Temple of Truth,	NA
iti38:8.5	rid of sorrow, looks upon the people	NA
iti38:8.6	swamped with sorrow, <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age.”	NA

iti39:2.1	“Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has two approaches to teaching Dhamma.	NA
iti39:2.2	What two?	NA
iti39:2.3	‘See evil as evil’—	NA
iti39:2.4	this is the first approach to teaching Dhamma.	NA
iti39:2.5	‘Having seen evil as evil, be disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed from it’—	NA
iti39:2.6	this is the second approach to teaching Dhamma.	NA
iti39:2.7	The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has these two approaches to teaching Dhamma.”	NA
iti39:2.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti39:2.9	On this it is said:	NA
iti39:3.1	“See the two approaches for	NA
iti39:3.2	explaining the Dhamma	NA
iti39:3.3	used by the Realized One, the Buddha,	NA
iti39:3.4	compassionate for all beings:	NA
iti39:4.1	see that that is evil,	NA
iti39:4.2	and be dispassionate towards it.	NA
iti39:4.3	Then, with a mind free of desire,	NA
iti39:4.4	you will make an end of suffering.”	NA

iti40:2.1	“Mendicants, ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities, with lack of conscience and prudence following along.	NA
iti40:2.2	Knowledge precedes the attainment of skillful qualities, with conscience and prudence following along.”	NA
iti40:2.3	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti40:2.4	On this it is said:	NA
iti40:3.1	“Bad destinies of whatever kind,	NA
iti40:3.2	in this world or the next,	NA
iti40:3.3	are all rooted in ignorance,	NA
iti40:3.4	compounded of greed and desire.	NA
iti40:4.1	Since one of corrupt wishes is	NA
iti40:4.2	unconscientious, lacking regard for others,	NA
iti40:4.3	they create much wickedness,	NA
iti40:4.4	which sends them to a place of loss.	NA
iti40:5.1	Therefore, dispelling desire	NA
iti40:5.2	and greed and ignorance,	NA
iti40:5.3	a mendicant arousing knowledge	NA

iti41:0.4	Bereft of Wisdom	NA
iti41:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti41:2.1	“Those sentient beings are truly bereft, mendicants, who are bereft of noble wisdom.	NA
iti41:2.2	They live unhappily in this very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—	NA
iti41:2.3	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a bad rebirth.	NA
iti41:2.4	Those sentient beings are not bereft who are not bereft of noble wisdom.	NA
iti41:2.5	In this very life they’re happy—free of distress, anguish, and fever—	NA
iti41:2.6	and when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect a good rebirth.”	NA
iti41:2.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti41:2.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti41:3.1	“See the world with its gods,	NA
iti41:3.2	bereft of wisdom,	NA
iti41:3.3	habituated to name and form,	NA
iti41:3.4	imagining this is truth.	NA
iti41:4.1	Wisdom is best in the world,	NA
iti41:4.2	as it leads to penetration,	NA
iti41:4.3	through which one rightly understands	NA
iti41:4.4	the ending of rebirth and continued existence.	NA
iti41:5.1	Gods and humans envy them,	NA
iti41:5.2	the Buddhas, ever mindful,	NA
iti41:5.3	of laughing wisdom,	NA
iti41:5.4	bearing their final body.”	NA

iti42:0.4	Bright Things	NA
iti42:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti42:2.1	“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world.	NA
iti42:2.2	What two?	NA
iti42:2.3	Conscience and prudence.	NA
iti42:2.4	If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of tutors and respected people.	NA
iti42:2.5	The world would become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals.	NA
iti42:2.6	But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of tutors and respected people.”	NA
iti42:2.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti42:2.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti42:3.1	“Those in whom conscience and prudence	NA
iti42:3.2	are never found at all,	NA
iti42:3.3	have lost their bright roots,	NA
iti42:3.4	and fare on in birth and death.	NA

iti43:0.4	Free of Rebirth	NA
iti43:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti43:2.1	“There is, mendicants, freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned.	NA
iti43:2.2	If there were no freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned, then you would find no escape here from rebirth, from what has been produced, made, and conditioned.	NA
iti43:2.3	But since there is freedom from rebirth, freedom from what has been produced, made, and conditioned, an escape is found from rebirth, from what has been produced, made, and conditioned.”	NA
iti43:2.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti43:2.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti43:3.1	“What’s reborn, produced, and arisen,	NA
iti43:3.2	made, conditioned, not lasting,	NA
iti43:3.3	wrapped in old age and death,	NA
iti43:3.4	frail, a nest of disease,	NA
iti43:4.1	generated by food and the conduit to rebirth:	NA
iti43:4.2	that’s not fit to delight in.	NA
iti43:4.3	The escape from that is peaceful,	NA
iti43:4.4	beyond the scope of logic, everlasting,	NA
iti43:5.1	where nothing is reborn or arisen,	NA
iti43:5.2	the sorrowless, stainless state,	NA
iti43:5.3	the cessation of all painful things,	NA
iti43:5.4	the blissful stilling of conditions.”	NA

iti44:0.4	Elements of Extinguishment	NA
iti44:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti44:2.1	“There are, mendicants, these two elements of extinguishment.	NA
iti44:2.2	What two?	NA
iti44:2.3	The element of extinguishment with residue, and the element of extinguishment with no residue.	NA
iti44:3.1	And what is the element of extinguishment with residue?	NA
iti44:3.2	It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.	NA
iti44:3.3	Their five sense faculties still remain. So long as their senses have not gone they continue to experience the agreeable and disagreeable, to feel pleasure and pain.	NA
iti44:3.4	The ending of greed, hate, and delusion in them	NA
iti44:3.5	is called the element of extinguishment with residue.	NA
iti44:4.1	And what is the element of extinguishment with no residue?	NA
iti44:4.2	It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.	NA
iti44:4.3	For them, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.	NA
iti44:4.4	This is called the element of extinguishment with no residue.	NA
iti44:4.5	These are the two elements of extinguishment.”	NA
iti44:4.6	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti44:4.7	On this it is said:	NA
iti44:5.1	“These two elements of extinguishment <j>have been explained	NA
iti44:5.2	by the Clear-eyed One, <j>the unattached, the unaffected.	NA
iti44:5.3	One element pertains to this life—	NA
iti44:5.4	that with residue <j>though the conduit to rebirth has ended;	NA
iti44:5.5	and that with no residue, <j>which pertains to what follows this life,	NA
iti44:5.6	where all states of existence cease.	NA
iti44:6.1	Those who have fully understood <j>the unconditioned state—	NA
iti44:6.2	their minds freed, the conduit to rebirth ended—	NA
iti44:6.3	attained to the heart of the Dhamma, <j>they delight in ending,	NA
iti44:6.4	the unaffected ones have given up <j>all states of existence.”	NA

iti45:2.1	“Enjoy retreat, mendicants, love retreat. Be committed to inner serenity of the heart, don’t neglect absorption, be endowed with discernment, and frequent empty huts.	NA
iti45:2.2	A mendicant who enjoys retreat can expect one of two results:	NA
iti45:2.3	enlightenment in this very life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”	NA
iti45:2.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti45:2.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti45:3.1	“With minds at peace, alert,	NA
iti45:3.2	mindful and meditative,	NA
iti45:3.3	they rightly discern the Dhamma,	NA
iti45:3.4	unconcerned for sensual pleasures.	NA
iti45:4.1	Delighting in diligence, peaceful,	NA
iti45:4.2	seeing fear in negligence,	NA
iti45:4.3	such a one can’t decline,	NA
iti45:4.4	and has drawn near to extinguishment.”	NA

iti46:2.2	A mendicant who lives in this way can expect one of two results:	NA

iti46:2.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti46:3.1	“The training fulfilled, not liable to decline,	NA
iti46:3.2	overseen by wisdom, seer of rebirth’s end;	NA
iti46:3.3	that sage bears their final body;	NA
iti46:3.4	they have disposed of Māra, I declare, <j>and gone beyond old age.	NA
iti46:4.1	Therefore be always enjoying absorption, <j>immersed in samādhi,	NA
iti46:4.2	energetic, seers of rebirth’s end.	NA
iti46:4.3	Having overcome Māra and his armies, mendicants,	NA
iti46:4.4	go beyond birth and death.”	NA

iti47:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti47:2.1	“A mendicant should meditate wakeful, mendicants, mindful and aware, joyful and clear, and at times discern the skillful qualities in that state.	NA
iti47:2.2	A mendicant who meditates in this way can expect one of two results:	NA
iti47:2.3	enlightenment in this very life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”	NA
iti47:2.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA

iti47:4.3	rightly investigating the Dhamma in good time,	NA

iti47:5.1	That’s why you should apply yourself to wakefulness.	NA
iti47:5.2	A keen and alert mendicant, possessing absorption,	NA
iti47:5.3	having cut the fetter of birth and old age,	NA
iti47:5.4	would experience supreme awakening <j>in this very life.”	NA

iti48:2.1	“Mendicants, these two are bound for a place of loss, bound for hell, if they don’t give up this fault.	NA
iti48:2.2	What two?	NA
iti48:2.3	Someone who is unchaste, but claims to be chaste; and someone who makes a groundless accusation of unchastity against a person whose chastity is pure.	NA
iti48:2.4	These are the two who are bound for a place of loss, bound for hell, if they don’t give up this fault.”	NA
iti48:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti48:2.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti48:3.1	“A liar goes to hell,	NA
iti48:3.2	as does one who denies what they did.	NA
iti48:3.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,	NA
iti48:3.4	those men of base deeds.	NA
iti48:4.1	Many who wear a scrap of ocher cloth	_Kāsāvakaṇṭhā_ is usually taken as “ochre-necks” with _kaṇṭha_ in the sense “throat”, but the commentary is not so clear: “It seems that, having tied a single ochre scrap (_khaṇḍa_) around their hand or neck (_gīvā_) they wander about.” Thus while the commentary mentions the neck, it directly glosses _kaṇṭha_ with _khaṇḍa_, a term for a scrap or portion; eg. a _cammakhaṇḍa_ is an item made from scraps of leather ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:2.1.8]()). _Khaṇḍa_ is doubly appropriate, since it is a common word for “broken” precepts.
iti48:4.2	are unrestrained and wicked.	NA
iti48:4.3	Being wicked, they are reborn in hell	NA
iti48:4.4	due to their bad deeds.	NA
iti48:5.1	It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained	NA
iti48:5.2	to eat an iron ball,	NA

iti49:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti49:2.1	“Overcome by two misconceptions, mendicants, some gods and humans get stuck, some overreach, while those with vision see.	NA
iti49:3.1	And how do some get stuck?	NA
iti49:3.2	Because of love, delight, and enjoyment of existence, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of existence, the minds of some gods and humans do not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided.	NA
iti49:3.3	That is how some get stuck.	NA
iti49:4.1	And how do some overreach?	NA
iti49:4.2	Some, becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with existence, delight in ending existence:	NA
iti49:4.3	‘When this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death:	NA
iti49:4.4	that is peaceful, that is sublime, that is how it is.’	NA
iti49:4.5	That is how some overreach.	NA
iti49:5.1	And how do those with vision see?	NA
iti49:5.2	It’s when a mendicant sees what has come to be as having come to be.	NA
iti49:5.3	Seeing this, they are practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be.	NA
iti49:5.4	That is how those with vision see.”	NA
iti49:5.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti49:5.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti49:6.1	“Those who see what has come to be <j>as having come to be,	NA
iti49:6.2	and see the transcendence of what has come to be,	NA
iti49:6.3	are freed in accord with the truth,	NA
iti49:6.4	with the ending of craving for continued existence.	NA
iti49:7.1	They completely understand what has come to be,	NA
iti49:7.2	rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state,	NA

iti72:2.3	Renunciation is the escape from sensual pleasures. Formlessness is the escape from form. Cessation is the escape from whatever is created, conditioned, and dependently originated.	NA

iti73:3.1	“There are beings in the realm of luminous form,	NA
iti73:3.2	and others stuck in the formless.	NA

iti74:2.2	What three?	NA
iti74:2.3	One who betters their birth, one who equals their birth, one who fails their birth.	NA
iti74:3.1	And how does a child better their birth?	NA
iti74:3.2	It’s when a child’s parents	NA
iti74:3.3	have not gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
iti74:3.4	They kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, and consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They’re immoral, of bad character.	NA
iti74:3.5	But their child	NA
iti74:3.6	has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
iti74:3.7	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They’re ethical, of good character.	NA
iti74:3.8	That’s how a child betters their birth.	NA
iti74:4.1	And how does a child equal their birth?	NA
iti74:4.2	It’s when a child’s parents	NA
iti74:4.3	have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.	NA
iti74:4.4	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They’re ethical, of good character.	NA
iti74:4.5	And their child	NA

iti74:4.7	They don’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. They’re ethical, of good character.	NA
iti74:4.8	That’s how a child equals their birth.	NA

iti74:6.1	“The astute wish for a child	NA
iti74:6.2	who betters or equals their birth;	NA
iti74:6.3	not one who fails their birth,	NA
iti74:6.4	disgracing their family.	NA
iti74:7.1	These are the children in the world	NA

iti74:7.3	faithful, accomplished in ethics,	NA
iti74:7.4	bountiful, rid of stinginess.	NA

iti75:2.1	“Mendicants, these three people are found in the world.	NA
iti75:2.2	What three?	NA
iti75:2.3	One like a rainless cloud, one who rains locally, one who rains all over.	NA
iti75:3.1	And how is a person like a rainless cloud?	NA
iti75:3.2	It’s when a person doesn’t give to anyone at all—whether ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, supplicants, or beggars—such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.	NA
iti75:3.3	That’s how a person is like a rainless cloud.	NA
iti75:4.1	And how does a person rain locally?	NA
iti75:4.2	It’s when a person gives to some but not to others—whether ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, supplicants, or beggars—such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting.	NA
iti75:4.3	That’s how a person rains locally.	NA

iti75:5.3	That’s how a person rains all over.	NA
iti75:5.4	These are the three people found in the world.”	NA
iti75:5.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti75:5.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti75:6.1	“They don’t share the food and drink	NA

iti75:6.3	with ascetics or brahmins,	NA
iti75:6.4	with paupers, vagrants, or supplicants.	NA
iti75:6.5	They’re like a rainless cloud,	NA

iti75:7.1	They don’t give to some,	NA
iti75:7.2	to some they provide.	NA
iti75:7.3	They rain locally,	NA
iti75:7.4	so say the wise.	NA
iti75:8.1	Compassionate for all beings,	NA
iti75:8.2	that person distributes	NA
iti75:8.3	abundant food upon request,	NA
iti75:8.4	saying, “Give! Give!”	NA
iti75:9.1	The rain cloud rains forth,	NA
iti75:9.2	having thundered and roared,	NA
iti75:9.3	drenching the earth with water,	NA
iti75:9.4	soaking the uplands and valleys.	NA
iti75:10.1	Even so, such a person,	NA
iti75:10.2	having accumulated wealth	NA
iti75:10.3	by legitimate means,	NA
iti75:10.4	through their own hard work,	NA
iti75:10.5	rightly satisfies with food and drink	NA
iti75:10.6	those who have become supplicants.”	NA

iti76:0.4	Wishing for Happiness	NA
iti76:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti76:2.1	“Mendicants, an astute person who wishes for three kinds of happiness should take care of their ethics.	NA
iti76:2.2	What three?	NA
iti76:2.3	‘May I be be praised!’ ‘May I become rich!’ ‘When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’	NA
iti76:2.4	An astute person who wishes for these three kinds of happiness should protect their precepts.”	NA
iti76:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti76:2.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti76:3.1	“Wishing for three kinds of happiness—	NA
iti76:3.2	praise, prosperity,	NA
iti76:3.3	and to delight in heaven after passing away—	NA
iti76:3.4	the wise would take care of their ethics.	NA
iti76:4.1	Though you do no wrong,	NA
iti76:4.2	if you associate with one who does,	NA
iti76:4.3	you’re suspected of wrong,	NA
iti76:4.4	and your disrepute grows.	NA
iti76:5.1	Whatever kind of friend you make,	NA
iti76:5.2	with whom you associate,	NA
iti76:5.3	that’s how you become,	NA
iti76:5.4	for so it is when you share your life.	NA
iti76:6.1	The one who associates and the one associated with,	NA
iti76:6.2	the one contacted and the one who contacts another,	NA
iti76:6.3	are like an arrow smeared with poison	NA
iti76:6.4	that contaminates the quiver.	NA
iti76:6.5	The attentive, fearing contamination,	NA
iti76:6.6	would never have wicked comrades.	NA
iti76:7.1	A man who wraps	NA
iti76:7.2	putrid fish in blades of grass	NA
iti76:7.3	makes the grass stink—	NA
iti76:7.4	so it is when associating with fools.	NA
iti76:8.1	But one who wraps	NA
iti76:8.2	sandalwood incense in leaves	NA
iti76:8.3	makes the leaves fragrant—	NA
iti76:8.4	so it is when associating with the attentive.	NA
iti76:9.1	So, knowing they’ll end up	NA
iti76:9.2	like the wrapping, the astute	NA
iti76:9.3	would shun the wicked,	NA
iti76:9.4	and befriend the good.	NA
iti76:9.5	The wicked lead you to hell,	NA
iti76:9.6	the good help you to a good place.”	NA

iti77:0.4	Fragile	NA
iti77:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti77:2.1	“This body is fragile, mendicants, consciousness is liable to fade away, and all attachments are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.”	NA
iti77:2.2	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti77:2.3	On this it is said:	NA
iti77:3.1	“Knowing that the body is fragile,	NA
iti77:3.2	that consciousness is faded,	_Virāgunaṁ_ is a secondary derivation from _virāga_ with the _-una_ suffix. Also found at [mn112:6.2]().
iti77:3.3	and seeing the danger in attachments,	NA
iti77:3.4	they go beyond birth and death.	NA
iti77:3.5	Having attained ultimate peace,	NA
iti77:3.6	evolved, they await their time.”	NA

iti78:0.4	Converging Elements	NA
iti78:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti78:2.1	“Mendicants, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element:	NA
iti78:2.2	Those who have bad convictions come together and converge with those who have bad convictions.	NA
iti78:2.3	Those who have good convictions come together and converge with those who have good convictions.	NA
iti78:3.1	In the past …	NA
iti78:4.1	In the future …	NA
iti78:5.1	At present, too, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element.	NA
iti78:5.2	Those who have bad convictions come together and converge with those who have bad convictions.	NA
iti78:5.3	Those who have good convictions come together and converge with those who have good convictions.”	NA
iti78:5.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti78:5.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti78:6.1	“Socializing promotes entanglements;	NA
iti78:6.2	they’re cut off by being aloof.	NA
iti78:6.3	If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea,	NA
iti78:6.4	and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink.	NA
iti78:7.1	So too, a person who lives well	NA
iti78:7.2	sinks by relying on a lazy person.	NA
iti78:7.3	Hence you should avoid such	NA
iti78:7.4	a lazy person who lacks energy.	NA
iti78:8.1	Dwell with the noble ones	NA

iti79:2.2	What three?	NA
iti79:2.3	It’s when a mendicant relishes work,	NA

iti79:3.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti79:4.1	“Restless, they relish	NA
iti79:4.2	work, talk, and sleep.	NA
iti79:4.3	Such a mendicant is incapable	NA
iti79:4.4	of experiencing the highest awakening.	NA
iti79:5.1	That’s why one ought have few duties,	NA
iti79:5.2	being wakeful not restless.	NA
iti79:5.3	Such a mendicant is capable	NA

iti80:2.2	What three?	NA
iti80:2.3	The thought of status; of getting material things, honor, and popularity; and of fondness for others.	NA
iti80:2.4	These are the three unskillful thoughts.”	NA
iti80:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti80:2.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti80:3.1	“One concerned with being looked up to,	NA
iti80:3.2	with possessions, honor, and respect,	NA
iti80:3.3	with sharing joys with friends,	NA
iti80:3.4	is far from the ending of fetters.	NA

iti81:5.2	I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”	NA
iti81:8.2	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti81:8.3	On this it is said:	NA
iti81:9.1	“Whether they’re honored	NA

iti81:9.3	their immersion doesn’t waver	NA
iti81:9.4	as they live diligently.	NA

iti82:2.1	“Mendicants, these three cries are uttered among the gods on occasion.	NA
iti82:2.2	What three?	NA
iti82:2.3	When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, the gods cry out:	NA
iti82:2.4	‘This noble disciple intends to join battle with Māra!’	NA
iti82:2.5	This is the first occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.	NA
iti82:3.1	Furthermore, when a noble disciple meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening, the gods cry out:	NA
iti82:3.2	‘This noble disciple is joining battle with Māra!’	NA
iti82:3.3	This is the second occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.	NA
iti82:4.1	Furthermore, when a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, the gods cry out:	NA
iti82:4.2	‘This noble disciple has won victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle!’	NA
iti82:4.3	This is the third occasion a cry is uttered among the gods.	NA
iti82:4.4	These are the three cries that are uttered among the gods on occasion.”	NA
iti82:4.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti82:4.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti82:5.1	“Seeing the winner of the battle—	NA
iti82:5.2	a disciple of the Buddha,	NA
iti82:5.3	great of heart, intrepid—	NA
iti82:5.4	even the deities revere them:	NA
iti82:6.1	‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred!	NA

iti82:6.3	Having defeated the army of death,	NA
iti82:6.4	your liberation is unhindered.’	NA
iti82:7.1	And so the deities revere the one,	NA
iti82:7.2	who has achieved their heart’s desire.	NA
iti82:7.3	For they see nothing in them by means of which	NA
iti82:7.4	they might fall under the sway of Death.”	NA

iti83:0.4	Five Warning Signs	NA
iti83:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti83:2.1	“Mendicants, when a god is due to pass away from the realm of the gods, five warning signs appear.	NA
iti83:2.2	Their flower-garlands wither; their clothes become soiled; they sweat from the armpits; their physical appearance deteriorates; and they no longer delight in their heavenly throne.	_Kāye dubbaṇṇiyaṁ okkamati_ doesn’t refer to the dimming of a divine radiance. It describes a declining physical appearance ([an5.50:9.4]()).
iti83:2.3	When the other gods know that that godling is due to pass away, they wish them well in three ways:	NA
iti83:2.4	‘Sir, may you go from here to a good place!	NA
iti83:3.1	When you have gone to a good place, may you be blessed with good fortune!	NA
iti83:4.1	When you have been blessed with good fortune, may you become well grounded!’”	NA
iti83:5.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	NA
iti83:5.2	“Sir, what do the gods reckon to be going to a good place?	NA
iti83:6.1	What do they reckon to be blessed with good fortune?	NA
iti83:7.1	What do they reckon to become well grounded?”	NA
iti83:8.1	“It is human existence, mendicant, that the gods reckon to be going to a good place.	NA
iti83:9.1	When a human being gains faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One,	NA
iti83:9.2	that is what the gods reckon to be blessed with good fortune.	NA
iti83:10.1	When that faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep; when it’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world,	NA
iti83:10.2	that is what the gods reckon to become well grounded.”	NA
iti83:11.1	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti83:11.2	On this it is said:	NA
iti83:12.1	“When, with the fading of life,	NA
iti83:12.2	a god passes from the realm of the gods,	NA
iti83:12.3	the gods utter three cries	NA
iti83:12.4	of well-wishing:	NA
iti83:13.1	‘Go, worthy sir, from here to a good place,	NA
iti83:13.2	in the company of humans.	NA
iti83:13.3	As a human being, gain supreme faith	NA
iti83:13.4	in the true teaching.	NA
iti83:14.1	May that faith of yours be settled,	NA
iti83:14.2	with roots planted deep,	NA
iti83:14.3	unfaltering all life long	NA
iti83:14.4	in the true teaching so well proclaimed.	NA
iti83:15.1	Having given up bad conduct	NA
iti83:15.2	by way of body,	NA
iti83:15.3	speech, and mind,	NA
iti83:15.4	and whatever else is corrupt;	NA
iti83:16.1	and having done much good,	NA
iti83:16.2	by way of body,	NA
iti83:16.3	speech, and mind,	NA
iti83:16.4	limitless, free of attachments;	NA
iti83:17.1	then, having made much worldly merit	NA
iti83:17.2	by giving gifts,	NA
iti83:17.3	establish other colleagues	NA
iti83:17.4	in the true teaching, the spiritual life.’	NA
iti83:18.1	It is due to such sympathy	NA
iti83:18.2	that when the gods know a god	NA
iti83:18.3	is due to pass away, they wish them well:	NA
iti83:18.4	‘Come back, god, again and again!’”	NA

iti84:0.4	For the Welfare of the People	NA
iti84:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti84:2.1	“These three people, mendicants, arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
iti84:2.2	What three?	NA
iti84:2.3	It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.	NA
iti84:2.4	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
iti84:2.5	This is the first person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
iti84:3.1	Furthermore, it’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.	NA
iti84:3.2	They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
iti84:3.3	This is the second person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
iti84:4.1	Furthermore, it’s when a disciple of that Teacher is a trainee, a learned practitioner with precepts and observances intact.	NA
iti84:4.2	They teach Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
iti84:4.3	This is the third person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.	NA
iti84:4.4	These are the three people who arise in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.”	NA
iti84:4.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti84:4.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti84:5.1	“The Teacher is the first, the great seer,	NA
iti84:5.2	following whom is the evolved disciple,	NA
iti84:5.3	and then a trainee, a practitioner,	NA
iti84:5.4	learned, with precepts and observances intact.	NA
iti84:6.1	These three are first among gods and humans,	NA
iti84:6.2	beacons proclaiming the teaching!	NA
iti84:6.3	They fling open the door to freedom from death,	NA
iti84:6.4	freeing many from yokes.	NA

iti85:2.2	Let mindfulness of breathing be well-established internally in your presence.	NA
iti85:2.3	Meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions.	NA
iti85:2.4	As you meditate observing the ugliness of the body, you will give up desire for the body.	NA
iti85:2.5	When mindfulness of breathing is well-established internally in your presence, there will be no distressing external thoughts or wishes.	NA
iti85:2.6	When you meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, ignorance is given up and knowledge arises.”	NA
iti85:2.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti85:2.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti85:3.1	“Observing the ugliness of the body,	NA
iti85:3.2	mindful of the breath,	NA
iti85:3.3	one always keen sees	NA
iti85:3.4	the stilling of all activities.	NA
iti85:4.1	That mendicant sees rightly,	NA

iti86:2.1	“Regarding a mendicant practicing in line with the teaching, it is in line with the teaching to declare that	NA
iti86:2.2	this is what it means to practice in line with the teaching. When speaking, they speak in line with the teaching, not against it. When thinking, they think in line with the teaching, not against it. And rejecting both, they meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware.”	NA
iti86:2.3	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti86:2.4	On this it is said:	NA
iti86:3.1	“Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,	NA
iti86:3.2	contemplating the teaching,	NA

iti87:2.1	“Mendicants, these three unskillful thoughts are destroyers of sight, vision, and knowledge. They block wisdom, they’re on the side of distress, and they don’t lead to extinguishment.	NA

iti87:2.3	Thoughts of sensuality,	NA
iti87:2.4	malice,	NA

iti89:0.4	About Devadatta	NA
iti89:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti89:2.1	“Mendicants, overcome and overwhelmed by three things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.	NA
iti89:2.2	What three?	NA
iti89:2.3	Corrupt wishes …	NA
iti89:2.4	Bad friendship …	NA
iti89:2.5	When there is still more to be done, stopping half-way after achieving some insignificant distinction.	NA
iti89:2.6	Overcome and overwhelmed by these three things that oppose the true teaching, Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable.”	NA
iti89:2.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti89:2.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti89:3.1	“Let none of wicked desire	NA
iti89:3.2	ever be reborn into this world.	NA
iti89:3.3	And by this too you should know	NA
iti89:3.4	the place where those of corrupt wishes go.	NA
iti89:4.1	He once was considered astute,	NA
iti89:4.2	deemed to be evolved,	NA
iti89:4.3	his glory stood forth like a flame,	NA
iti89:4.4	the renowned Devadatta.	Commentary gives _me sutaṁ_ as variant here. But this construction is found in a number places with _vissuta_. See [mn86:18.40](), [thag16.8:15.2]().
iti89:5.1	Seduced by heedlessness,	NA
iti89:5.2	he attacked the Realized One.	NA
iti89:5.3	He has fallen to Avīci hell,	Despite its fame, this, together with its parallel at [pli-tv-kd17:4.8.11](), is the only mention of Avīci hell in early Buddhism. It became a standard hell in later texts of the Buddhists (eg. [kv23.3:1.10](), [vb3:23.4](), [cnd23:44.3]()) and Brahmans (eg. Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.28). The commentary explains _avīci_ as “without interval”, i.e. “unrelenting”; a similar explanation is cited by Vasubandhu at Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 3.58.
iti89:5.4	four-doored and terrifying.	Compare the description of hell as “four-doored” at [mn129:16.3]() = [mn130:16.3]() = [an3.36:16.1]().
iti89:6.1	When someone betrays the innocent,	NA
iti89:6.2	who have done no wrong,	NA
iti89:6.3	their bad deeds impact the one	NA
iti89:6.4	with corrupt heart, lacking regard for others.	NA
iti89:7.1	One might think to pollute	NA

iti89:7.3	but it wouldn’t work,	NA
iti89:7.4	for the sea is terribly large.	NA
iti89:8.1	So too when someone attacks	NA
iti89:8.2	with words the Realized One—	NA

iti89:9.3	A mendicant who walks the path	NA

iti90:0.4	The Best Kinds of Confidence	NA
iti90:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti90:2.1	“Mendicants, these three kinds of confidence are the best.	NA
iti90:2.2	What three?	NA
iti90:2.3	Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception.	NA
iti90:2.4	Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best.	NA
iti90:2.5	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.	NA
iti90:3.1	Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned. That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the abolishing of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.	NA
iti90:3.2	Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best.	NA
iti90:3.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.	NA
iti90:4.1	The Saṅgha of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.	NA
iti90:4.2	Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best.	NA
iti90:4.3	Having confidence in the best, the result is the best.	NA
iti90:4.4	These are the three best kinds of confidence.”	NA
iti90:4.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti90:4.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti90:5.1	“For those who, knowing the best teaching,	NA
iti90:5.2	base their confidence on the best—	NA
iti90:5.3	confident in the best Awakened One,	NA
iti90:5.4	supremely worthy of a religious donation;	NA
iti90:6.1	confident in the best teaching,	NA
iti90:6.2	the bliss of fading and stilling;	NA
iti90:6.3	confident in the best Saṅgha,	NA
iti90:6.4	the supreme field of merit—	NA
iti90:7.1	giving gifts to the best,	NA
iti90:7.2	the best of merit grows:	NA
iti90:7.3	the best lifespan, beauty,	NA
iti90:7.4	fame, reputation, happiness, and strength.	NA
iti90:8.1	An intelligent person gives to the best,	NA
iti90:8.2	settled on the best teaching.	NA
iti90:8.3	When they become a god or human,	NA
iti90:8.4	they rejoice at reaching the best.”	NA

iti91:0.4	Lifestyle	NA
iti91:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti91:2.1	“This is the last of lifestyles, mendicants, namely relying on alms.	The unusual use of _anta_ here is, I believe, a play on words. Per the commentary, it suggests the “least” of lifestyles, but it is also that which “makes an end” of suffering and future lives, as said just a few sentences below.
iti91:2.2	The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’	NA
iti91:2.3	Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason.	NA
iti91:2.4	Not to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.	The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. Generally, ordination should not be given in such cases, but if it is given, those performing it incur an offense of wrong-doing. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king ([pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1]()). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the thrust of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1]()). | Another man ordained to escape debt ([pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1]()). | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood ([pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1]()). | The only item that does not straightforwardly correspond is “in fear” (_bhayaṭṭa_). In the Vinaya sequence, the ordination of slaves appears at this point ([pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]()). The connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier Puṇṇikā, who speaks of living “in fear” of her masters’ abuse and beatings.
iti91:2.5	Rather, because they think: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.	NA
iti91:2.6	Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’	NA
iti91:2.7	That’s how this gentleman has gone forth.	NA
iti91:2.8	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties.	NA
iti91:2.9	Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness.	NA
iti91:2.10	I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life.”	NA
iti91:2.11	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti91:2.12	On this it is said:	NA
iti91:3.1	“They’ve left behind the pleasures of the lay life,	NA
iti91:3.2	and miss out on the goal of the ascetic life.	NA
iti91:3.3	Ruining it, they throw it away,	NA
iti91:3.4	and perish like a funeral firebrand.	NA
iti91:4.1	Many who wear a scrap of ocher cloth	NA
iti91:4.2	are unrestrained and wicked.	NA
iti91:4.3	Being wicked, they are reborn in hell	NA
iti91:4.4	due to their bad deeds.	NA
iti91:5.1	It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained	NA
iti91:5.2	to eat an iron ball,	NA
iti91:5.3	scorching, like a burning flame,	NA
iti91:5.4	than to eat the nation’s alms.”	NA

iti92:0.4	The Corner of the Cloak	NA
iti92:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti92:2.1	“Mendicants, suppose a mendicant were to hold the corner of my cloak and follow behind me step by step.	NA
iti92:2.2	Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties.	NA
iti92:2.3	Then they are far from me, and I from them.	NA
iti92:2.4	Why is that?	NA
iti92:2.5	Because that mendicant does not see the teaching.	NA
iti92:2.6	Not seeing the teaching, they do not see me.	NA
iti92:3.1	Suppose a mendicant were to live a hundred leagues away.	NA
iti92:3.2	Yet they do not covet sensual pleasures; they’re not infatuated, or full of ill will and malicious intent. They have established mindfulness, situational awareness and immersion, with unified mind and restrained faculties.	NA
iti92:3.3	Then they are close to me, and I to them.	NA
iti92:3.4	Why is that?	NA
iti92:3.5	Because that mendicant sees the teaching.	NA
iti92:3.6	Seeing the teaching, they see me.”	NA
iti92:3.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti92:3.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti92:4.1	“One full of desire and distress	NA
iti92:4.2	may follow close behind,	NA
iti92:4.3	yet see how distant they are—	NA
iti92:4.4	the stirred from the still,	NA
iti92:4.5	the burning from the quenched,	NA
iti92:4.6	the greedy from the greedless.	NA
iti92:5.1	An astute person who has understood	NA

iti93:0.4	Fire	NA
iti93:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti93:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three fires.	NA
iti93:2.2	What three?	NA
iti93:2.3	The fires of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
iti93:2.4	These are the three fires.”	NA
iti93:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti93:2.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti93:3.1	“The fire of greed burns a mortal,	NA
iti93:3.2	lustful, infatuated by sensual pleasures;	NA
iti93:3.3	while, fallen in the fire of hate,	NA
iti93:3.4	a person kills living creatures;	NA
iti93:4.1	and, bewildered by the fire of delusion,	NA
iti93:4.2	they miss the teaching of the noble ones.	NA
iti93:4.3	Not recognizing these three fires,	NA
iti93:4.4	people are caught up in substantial reality.	NA
iti93:5.1	They fill the ranks of hell,	NA
iti93:5.2	of birth as an animal,	NA
iti93:5.3	or of titans and ghosts,	NA
iti93:5.4	not freed from Māra’s bonds.	NA
iti93:6.1	But as to those committed day and night	NA
iti93:6.2	to the teaching of the Buddha:	NA
iti93:6.3	they extinguish the fire of greed,	NA
iti93:6.4	always perceiving ugliness;	NA
iti93:7.1	while those supreme persons	NA
iti93:7.2	extinguish the fire of hate with love;	NA
iti93:7.3	and the fire of delusion with the wisdom	NA
iti93:7.4	that leads to penetration.	NA
iti93:8.1	Having extinguished these fires, alert,	NA
iti93:8.2	tireless all day and night,	NA

iti94:2.2	When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.”	NA

iti95:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti95:2.1	“Mendicants, there are these three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures.	The prose phrasing in this sutta is obscure, so I have drawn out the meaning somewhat. According to the commentary, the first category refers to humans and certain devas.
iti95:2.2	What three?	NA
iti95:2.3	Some sensual pleasures are simply present; some are for those who love to imagine; and some are for those who control what is imagined by others.	NA
iti95:2.4	These are the three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures.”	NA
iti95:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti95:2.6	On this it is said:	NA

iti95:3.6	but don’t escape transmigration.	NA
iti95:4.1	Knowing this danger	NA
iti95:4.2	in sensual indulgence, an astute person	NA
iti95:4.3	would forsake all sensual pleasures,	NA
iti95:4.4	both human and heavenly.	NA
iti95:5.1	Having cut the stream so hard to pass,	NA
iti95:5.2	that’s tied to pleasant seeming things,	NA
iti95:5.3	they become fully extinguished,	NA

iti96:2.2	One unyoked from sensual pleasures but still yoked to rebirth is a non-returner, who comes not back to this place.	NA
iti96:2.3	One unyoked from both sensual pleasures and rebirth is a perfected one, who has ended defilements.”	NA

iti97:2.1	“Mendicants, in this teaching and training a mendicant of good morals, good practice, and good wisdom is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person.	Normally _kalyāṇadhamma_ means “good character”, but here it refers to the development of meditation.
iti97:3.1	And how does a mendicant have good morals?	NA
iti97:3.2	It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
iti97:3.3	That’s how a mendicant has good morals.	NA
iti97:3.4	Such is one of good morality.	NA
iti97:4.1	And how does one have good practice?	NA
iti97:4.2	It’s when a mendicant meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening.	NA
iti97:4.3	That’s how a mendicant has good practice.	NA
iti97:4.4	Such is one of good morality and good practice.	NA
iti97:5.1	And how does one have good wisdom?	NA
iti97:5.2	It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
iti97:5.3	That’s how a mendicant has good wisdom;	NA
iti97:6.1	Such is one of good morals, good practice, and good wisdom, who in this teaching and training is called consummate, accomplished, a supreme person.”	NA

iti98:2.3	The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching.	NA
iti98:3.1	There are these two kinds of sharing.	NA
iti98:3.2	Sharing things of the flesh and sharing the teaching.	NA
iti98:3.3	The better of these two kinds of sharing is sharing the teaching.	NA
iti98:4.1	There are these two kinds of support.	NA
iti98:4.2	Support in things of the flesh and support in the teaching.	NA

iti99:0.4	The Three Knowledges	NA
iti99:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti99:2.1	“Mendicants, I define a brahmin in terms of the teaching as one who is master of the three knowledges, not the other who merely repeats what they are told.	NA
iti99:3.1	How so?	NA
iti99:3.2	It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.	NA
iti99:3.3	This is the first knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
iti99:4.1	Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.	NA
iti99:4.2	This is the second knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
iti99:5.1	Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.	NA
iti99:5.2	This is the third knowledge which they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.	NA
iti99:5.3	That’s how I define a brahmin in terms of the teaching as one who is master of the three knowledges, not the other who merely repeats what they are told.”	NA
iti99:5.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti99:5.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti99:6.1	“One who knows their past lives,	NA
iti99:6.2	sees heaven and places of loss,	NA
iti99:6.3	and has attained the end of rebirth,	NA
iti99:6.4	is a sage of perfect insight.	NA
iti99:7.1	Because of these three knowledges	NA
iti99:7.2	a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges.	NA
iti99:7.3	That’s who I call a three-knowledge master,	NA
iti99:7.4	and not the other <j>who repeats what they are told.”	NA

iti100:2.2	You are my true-born sons, born from my mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heirs in the teaching, not in things of the flesh.	NA

iti100:3.3	The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching.	NA

iti100:6.2	An offering of things of the flesh and an offering of the teaching.	NA

iti100:6.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti100:6.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti100:7.1	“The Realized One, <j>compassionate for all living creatures,	NA
iti100:7.2	unstintingly offers teaching.	NA
iti100:7.3	Sentient beings revere him, <j>first among gods and humans,	NA

iti101:2.1	“Mendicants, these four trifles are easy to find and are blameless.	NA
iti101:2.2	What four?	NA
iti101:2.3	Rag-robes …	NA
iti101:2.4	A lump of almsfood …	NA
iti101:2.5	Lodgings at the root of a tree …	NA
iti101:2.6	Rancid urine as medicine …	NA
iti101:2.7	These four trifles are easy to find and are blameless.	NA
iti101:2.8	When a mendicant is content with trifles that are easy to find, they have one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say.”	NA
iti101:2.9	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti101:2.10	On this it is said:	NA
iti101:3.1	“When one is content with what’s blameless,	NA
iti101:3.2	trifling, and easy to find,	NA
iti101:3.3	they don’t get distressed	NA
iti101:3.4	about lodgings, robes,	NA

iti101:4.1	These qualities are said to be	NA
iti101:4.2	integral to the ascetic life.	NA

iti102:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti102:2.1	“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.	NA
iti102:2.2	For one who knows and sees what?	NA
iti102:2.3	The ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
iti102:2.4	The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this.”	NA
iti102:2.5	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti102:2.6	On this it is said:	NA
iti102:3.1	“As a trainee trains,	NA
iti102:3.2	following the straight road,	NA
iti102:3.3	first they know about ending;	NA
iti102:3.4	enlightenment follows in the same lifetime.	NA
iti102:4.1	Then to one freed through enlightenment	NA
iti102:4.2	the knowledge of ending arises,	NA
iti102:4.3	the supreme knowledge of freedom,	NA
iti102:4.4	with the ending of the fetters.	NA

iti103:2.1	“Mendicants, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
iti103:2.2	I don’t deem them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables don’t realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and don’t live having realized it with their own insight.	NA
iti103:3.1	There are ascetics and brahmins who truly understand about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
iti103:3.2	I regard them as true ascetics and brahmins. Those venerables realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin, and live having realized it with their own insight.”	NA

iti103:4.5	And they do not know the path	NA
iti103:4.6	that leads to the stilling of suffering.	NA
iti103:5.1	They lack the heart’s release,	NA
iti103:5.2	as well as the release by wisdom.	NA
iti103:5.3	Unable to make an end,	NA
iti103:5.4	they continue to be reborn and grow old.	NA
iti103:6.1	But there are those who understand suffering	NA

iti104:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti104:2.1	“Mendicants, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. They advise and instruct. They educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire, and can rightly explain the true teaching. Even the sight of those mendicants is very helpful, I say.	For _alaṁsamakkhātāro_, compare [dn29:11.2]().
iti104:2.2	Even to hear them,	NA
iti104:2.3	approach them,	NA
iti104:2.4	pay homage to them,	NA
iti104:2.5	recollect them,	NA
iti104:2.6	or go forth after them is very helpful, I say.	NA
iti104:2.7	Why is that?	NA
iti104:2.8	For one who frequents and associates with such mendicants, their incomplete spectrum of ethics is completed. Their incomplete spectrum of immersion … wisdom … freedom … knowledge and vision of freedom is completed.	NA
iti104:2.9	Such mendicants are called ‘teachers’, ‘leaders of the caravan’, ‘strife-discarders’, ‘dispellers of darkness’, ‘bringers of light’, ‘luminaries’, ‘lamps’, ‘candlebearers’, ‘beacons’, ‘noble ones’, and ‘clear-eyed ones’.”	NA
iti104:2.10	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti104:2.11	On this it is said:	NA
iti104:3.1	“This is a reason for joy	NA
iti104:3.2	for those who understand:	NA
iti104:3.3	that is, those who are evolved,	NA
iti104:3.4	the noble ones living righteously.	NA

iti105:0.3	The Chapter on the Brahmin’s Offering of the Teaching	NA
iti105:0.4	The Arising of Craving	NA
iti105:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti105:2.1	“Mendicants, there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.	NA
iti105:2.2	What four?	NA
iti105:2.3	For the sake of robes,	NA
iti105:2.4	almsfood,	NA
iti105:2.5	lodgings,	NA
iti105:2.6	or rebirth in this or that state.	NA
iti105:2.7	These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant.”	NA
iti105:2.8	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti105:2.9	On this it is said:	NA
iti105:3.1	“Craving is a person’s partner	NA
iti105:3.2	as they transmigrate on this long journey.	NA
iti105:3.3	They go from this state to another,	NA
iti105:3.4	but don’t escape transmigration.	NA
iti105:4.1	Knowing this danger,	NA
iti105:4.2	that craving is the cause of suffering—	NA
iti105:4.3	rid of craving, free of grasping,	NA
iti105:4.4	a mendicant would wander mindful.”	NA
iti105:5.1	This too is a matter that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.	NA

iti106:0.3	The Chapter on the Brahmin’s Offering of the Teaching	NA
iti106:0.4	With Divinity	NA
iti106:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti106:2.1	“Mendicants, a family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with Divinity.	NA
iti106:2.2	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the old deities.	NA
iti106:2.3	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first tutors.	NA
iti106:2.4	A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods.	NA
iti106:3.1	‘Divinity’ is a term for your parents.	NA
iti106:3.2	‘Old deities’ is a term for your parents.	NA
iti106:3.3	‘First tutors’ is a term for your parents.	NA
iti106:3.4	‘Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods’ is a term for your parents.	NA
iti106:3.5	Why is that?	NA
iti106:3.6	Parents are very helpful to their children, they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world.”	NA
iti106:3.7	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti106:3.8	On this it is said:	NA
iti106:4.1	“Parents are said to be ‘Divinity’	NA
iti106:4.2	and ‘first tutors’.	NA
iti106:4.3	They’re worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods <j>from their children,	NA
iti106:4.4	for they love their offspring.	NA
iti106:5.1	Therefore an astute person	NA
iti106:5.2	would revere them and honor them	NA
iti106:5.3	with food and drink,	NA
iti106:5.4	clothes and bedding,	NA
iti106:5.5	anointing and bathing,	NA
iti106:5.6	and by washing their feet.	NA
iti106:6.1	Because they look after	NA
iti106:6.2	their parents like this,	NA
iti106:6.3	they’re praised in this life by the astute,	NA
iti106:6.4	and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”	NA

iti107:2.1	“Mendicants, brahmins and householders are very helpful to you, as they provide you with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
iti107:2.2	And you are very helpful to brahmins and householders, as you teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And you reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
iti107:2.3	That is how this spiritual path is lived supporting each other in order to cross over the flood and make a complete end of suffering.”	NA
iti107:2.4	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti107:2.5	On this it is said:	NA
iti107:3.1	“The home-dweller and the homeless,	NA
iti107:3.2	supporting each other,	NA
iti107:3.3	find success in the true teaching,	NA
iti107:3.4	the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.	NA

iti108:2.4	They haven’t left this teaching and training, and they do achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.”	NA

iti109:0.4	A River	NA
iti109:1.1	This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.	NA
iti109:2.1	“Suppose a person was being carried along by a river current that seemed nice and pleasant.	NA
iti109:2.2	If a person with clear eyes saw them, they’d say:	NA
iti109:2.3	‘Worthy man, even though the river current carrying you along seems nice and pleasant, downstream there is a lake with waves and whirlpools, saltwater crocodiles and monsters. When you reach there it will result in death or deadly pain.’	NA
iti109:2.4	Then, when they heard what was said, they’d paddle against the stream using their hands and feet.	NA
iti109:3.1	I’ve made up this simile to make a point.	NA
iti109:3.2	And this is the point.	NA
iti109:3.3	‘River current’ is a term for craving.	NA
iti109:4.1	‘Seeming nice and pleasant’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.	NA
iti109:5.1	‘A downstream lake’ is a term for the five lower fetters.	NA

iti109:9.1	‘Against the stream’ is a term for renunciation.	NA
iti109:10.1	‘Paddling with hands and feet’ is a term for rousing energy.	NA
iti109:11.1	‘A person with clear eyes’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	NA
iti109:11.2	The Buddha spoke this matter.	NA
iti109:11.3	On this it is said:	NA
iti109:12.1	“In pain they’d give up sensual pleasures,	NA
iti109:12.2	aspiring to the future sanctuary from the yoke.	NA
iti109:12.3	With deep understanding and heart well freed,	NA
iti109:12.4	they’d experience universal liberation.	The duplicated _tattha tattha_ is not used in a limiting sense such as the English “here and there”, but in a distributive sense, “in each and every place”.
iti109:12.5	That knowledge master <j>who has completed the spiritual journey,	NA
iti109:12.6	and gone to the end of the world, <j>is called ‘one who has gone beyond’.”	NA

ja1:1.1	Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!	NA
ja1:2.1	When some have an unfailing basis,	_Apaṇṇaka_ (“unfailing”) is a gambling term, where _paṇṇa_ appears as a form of the number five. While a hand of four dice was “perfect” (_kaṭa_), the fifth “losing” (_kali_) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). _Apaṇṇaka_ is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”. See further note on [mn60:12.5]().
ja1:2.2	while sophists speak of a second way,	In the prose story, the “sophists” (_takkikā_) are compared to a native spirit (_yakkha_) who tried to persuade a caravan to abandon its water in the desert.

ja1:2.4	would take up what is unfailing.	This line draws on the gambling imagery: one would “take up” (_gaṇhe_) that which is “unfailing”, namely a “winning hand” (_kaṭaggāha_). In the ancient Vedic game of chance, a large quantity of _vibhītaka_ (“bedda”) nuts were placed in a hollow, from which players would take a handful. If the number of nuts was divisible by four, it was said to be a “perfect” (_kaṭa_) “hand” (_gāha_).

The commentary reads the ending (_-ehi_) as locative (_-esu_). | Here _santhava_ appears equivalent to Sanskrit _saṁstāva_, a place for gathering, especially for recitation. The commentary explains, rather, as “those who are residents and those who are acquaintances”.
ja14:1.3	The domesticated Wind-deer	According to Haṁsadeva’s 13th century Mṛgapakṣiśāstra, the “wind-deer” (_vātamiga_, Sanskrit _vātamṛga_) is fast, skilled at escaping weapons and vanishing from sight; dwelling in deep forests, it is lean with long legs and branched antlers. At [sn9.8:4.2]() it is said to be flighty and easily startled. | “Domesticated” is _gehanissitaṁ_, which is to be accepted over the metrically-incorrect variant _gahananissitaṁ_. The confusion is evidently an old one, since the commentary glosses _geha_ (“home”) with _gahanaṭṭhāna_ (“place in the jungle”).

The verses and stories form a pair with the next Jātaka. Though the verses are in different metres, the prevalence of shared terms, ideas, and poetic play shows they must have been composed together. | The commentary takes _kharādiye_ as the vocative of  _kharādiyā_, the name of the Bodhisatta’s sister. However, I take _khara_ as “ass, mule” and _ādiye_ as second optative, “you should accept”. Asses have solid hooves, as opposed to the cloven-footed deer.

ja16:1.4	Excelling with these six tricks, he deserves a chance.”	Here _kalā_ means “trick, deceit”. | _Chahi kalāhi_ here chimes with _sattahi kālāti_ in the previous verse. The “six tricks” are the three ways of playing dead, the eight hooves, sneaking a drink at midnight, and breathing through one nostril. How eight hooves is a ruse is unclear, but its central role suggests it was the kernel of the two verses. | Commentary takes _bhāgineyyo_ in its usual sense of “nephew”, but I think it is from _bhāgin_ by analogy with _dakkhiṇeyyo_, “one who deserves a share”.

ja59:1.1	Blow, blow, don’t overblow,	A drummer with his boy earned money playing drums at a festival. On the return journey, however, the boy’s incessant beating attracted  the attention of bandits. | The story and title speak of a “drum” (_bheri_), while the verse uses _dhamati_, which normally means “blows”. The repeated idiom recalls the onomatopoetic Sanskrit _dhamadhamā_, which in Marathi, Hindi, Kannada, and Nepali has the sense of a repeated drumbeat. On the other hand, the next verse is almost identical and concerns the blower of a conch or horn. Rather than rendering the two verses to match the commentary, I assume they originally had the same sense.

The commentary explains, rather, as _asatiyo_ (“false”) and also _asāta_ (“displeasing”). Perhaps the curious “spell of the unpleasant” was retroactively invented to explain this word.

This was to feed his gambling addiction by refuting his adversary’s lucky charm, which was an asseveration of truth that all women were faithless. When the brahmin started winning at dice, his adversary employed a knave to restore his fortunes. Cruelly deceiving her waiting-woman, the knave managed to sneak in and seduce the wife. To help the knave make his escape, the young wife persuaded her husband to play the harp while she danced, asking him to cover his eyes for modesty’s sake. On discovering the ruse, the brahmin beat his wife and chased her away. Somehow, the moral of the story is that *women* can’t be trusted.

ja69:1.3	and now shall consume again.	The verse can be read in two ways. The story assumes that the snake refuses to take back the poison. But there is no negative particle qualifying the verb, so it must be read as a rhetorical question: “I shall take back what I have vomited?” In this reading, they refuse to take it back even “for the sake of life” because they are threatened with death if they refuse. Alternatively, however, the speaker is saying that they have vomited the poison for the sake of life—i.e. that they took a purgative—but nonetheless they shall eat their poisoned vomit even though it means their death. In this reading, the speaker is likely a person rather than a snake, and the “vomit” actual vomit, not emitted poison. The reason why they resort to such drastic measures is not clear, and I fear we have lost the original story that would have made the context meaningful. Nonetheless, I think this interpretation reflects the Pali more directly.

Vedic ritualists were very particular about what wood was to be used for what purpose (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.8.4.1), and _varaṇa_ wood, due to its association with the rites of death, was not to be used to make offerings in the life-giving Homa fire ritual (Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 1.6.7). The association of the _varaṇa_ with death is maintained in the commentarial story behind [ja38](), where the crane kills fish on a branch of this tree. This verse, I suggest, was originally a warning against using the wrong wood for the ritual.

Thus the two go together, as they do often in the Vedas. | The story and this verse appears in [cp30](), where it illustrates the perfection of truth.
ja75:1.2	Wipe out the trove of the crow!	The commentary says the sense is that the stranded fish are the “trove” (_nidhi_) of the feasting crow, which is “wiped out” by being covered with water.

The original verse may have focused more specifically on the “trove of the crow”, i.e. the deathly drought, from which the waters offer relief. | In Vedic tradition, the waters are invoked to save one from the sin wiped by the crow’s mouth, the kiss of the dread goddess of black death, Nirṛti (Atharva Veda 7.64). The wish to harm the crow is distinctly un-Buddhist and more characteristic of the Atharva. Otherwise, though, the two passages are not similar, except they both end with the same verb.

snp1.1:7.1	Their mental vibrations are cleared away,	The commentary interprets _vitakka_ as “wrong thoughts”, but the identical line at [ud6.7:4.1]() clearly refers to _jhāna_. The commentary also reads _vidhūpitā_ as “burning up”, but _vidhūpa_ refers to clearing the mist, smoke, or incense.

snp1.1:9.1	They have not run too far nor run back,	NA
snp1.1:9.2	for they know that nothing in the world <j>is what it seems.	Bodhi, Norman, and Ṭhānissaro all render _vitatha_ as “unreal”. This seems overly idealistic for early Buddhism, so I take the prefix _vi_ in the sense of “distorts”, “twists”.

snp1.2:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 1.2	NA
snp1.2:0.2	The Wealthy Rancher	NA
snp1.2:1.1	“I’ve boiled my rice and drawn my milk,”	This verse evidently refers to his completion of a daily household (Sanskrit _gṛhya_) rite involving offering of cooked food (Sanskrit _pākayajña_), guaranteeing abundant cattle and offspring (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.8.1.9).
snp1.2:1.2	said Dhaniya the rancher,	_Dhaniya_ means “wealthy man”, and _gopa_, while it literally means “cowherd”, here refers to someone who owns and manages a substantial cattle estate, i.e. a “rancher”.
snp1.2:1.3	“I stay with my family along the bank of the Mahī.	NA
snp1.2:1.4	My hut is roofed, my sacred fire kindled:	“My fire kindled” (_āhito gini_, cf. Sanskrit _āhitāgni_) refers to one who has set up his fire altar.
snp1.2:1.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	Through his offering he invokes the god of thunder and rain (Indra or Pajjuna, Sanskrit Parjanya) to bless the land with life-giving waters (per eg. Atharva Veda 4.15).
snp1.2:2.1	“I boil not with anger <j>and have drawn out hard-heartedness,”	The verse first puns _pakkodano_ (“boiled rice”) with _akkodhano_ (“without anger”), then _khīra_ (“milk”) with _khila_ (“hard-heartedness”).
snp1.2:2.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:2.3	“I stay for one night along the bank of the Mahī.	NA
snp1.2:2.4	My hut is wide open, my fire is quenched:	The Buddha directly counters the kindled Vedic fire with Nibbana as the quenching of the flame.
snp1.2:2.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:3.1	“No gadflies or mosquitoes are found,”	NA
snp1.2:3.2	said Dhaniya,	NA
snp1.2:3.3	“cows graze on the lush meadow grass.	NA
snp1.2:3.4	They get by even when the rain comes:	NA
snp1.2:3.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:4.1	“I bound a raft and made it well,”	NA
snp1.2:4.2	said the Buddha,	Norman points out that this verse is not a proper response to the previous and suggests that a verse has been lost. I agree, but I disagree there is a contradiction in the sense. Rather, the verse tells a story over time. I translate to bring out the meaning.
snp1.2:4.3	“and with it I crossed over, went to the far shore, <j>and dispelled the flood.	NA
snp1.2:4.4	Now I have no need for a raft:	NA
snp1.2:4.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:5.1	“My wife is obedient, not wanton,”	NA
snp1.2:5.2	said Dhaniya,	NA
snp1.2:5.3	“long have we lived together happily.	NA
snp1.2:5.4	I hear nothing bad about her:	NA
snp1.2:5.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:6.1	“My mind is obedient and freed,”	NA
snp1.2:6.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:6.3	“long nurtured and well-tamed.	NA
snp1.2:6.4	Nothing bad is found in me:	NA
snp1.2:6.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:7.1	“I am self-employed,”	NA
snp1.2:7.2	said Dhaniya,	NA
snp1.2:7.3	“and my healthy children likewise.	I’m not convinced by the commentary’s “not separated”. It doesn’t seem to occur in this meaning elsewhere, and lacks a connection with the opening line. Surely the whole verse must be about the children, which requires that there be a comparison made with the first line. The point is, I think, that the children follow the father and have become self-sufficient. This also echoes better with the Buddha’s response.
snp1.2:7.4	I hear nothing bad about them:	NA
snp1.2:7.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:8.1	“I am no-one’s lackey,”	NA
snp1.2:8.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:8.3	“with what I have earned I wander the world.	NA
snp1.2:8.4	I have no need for wages:	NA
snp1.2:8.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:9.1	“I have heifers and sucklings,”	NA
snp1.2:9.2	said Dhaniya,	NA
snp1.2:9.3	“cows in calf and breeding cows.	NA
snp1.2:9.4	I’ve also got a bull, leader of the herd here:	NA
snp1.2:9.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:10.1	“I have no heifers or sucklings,”	NA
snp1.2:10.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:10.3	“no cows in calf or breeding cows.	NA
snp1.2:10.4	I haven’t got a bull, leader of the herd here:	NA
snp1.2:10.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:11.1	“The stakes are driven in, unshakable,”	NA
snp1.2:11.2	said Dhaniya,	NA
snp1.2:11.3	“The grass halters are new and well-woven,	NA
snp1.2:11.4	not even the sucklings can break them:	NA
snp1.2:11.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:12.1	“Like a bull I broke the bonds,”	NA
snp1.2:12.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:12.3	“like an elephant I snapped the vine.	NA
snp1.2:12.4	I will never lie in a womb again:	NA
snp1.2:12.5	so rain forth, heavens, if you wish.”	NA
snp1.2:13.1	Right then a thundercloud rained down,	For all Dhaniya’s offerings, his capricious god deals out life-threatening flood instead of life-giving waters. It is not just that his supposed security turns out to be insecure, but that his religious devotions were misplaced, setting the stage for his conversion.
snp1.2:13.2	soaking the uplands and valleys.	NA
snp1.2:13.3	Hearing the heavens rain down,	NA
snp1.2:13.4	Dhaniya said this:	NA
snp1.2:14.1	“It is no small gain for us	NA
snp1.2:14.2	that we have seen the Buddha.	NA
snp1.2:14.3	We come to you for refuge, Clear-eyed One.	NA
snp1.2:14.4	O great sage, please be our Teacher.	NA
snp1.2:15.1	My wife and I, obedient,	NA
snp1.2:15.2	shall lead the spiritual life under the Holy One.	Norman and Bodhi apparently read the middle form _carāmase_ as imperative, but I take it as the present indicative in the sense of definite future.
snp1.2:15.3	Gone beyond birth and death,	NA
snp1.2:15.4	we shall make an end of suffering.”	NA
snp1.2:16.1	“Children bring you delight!”	NA
snp1.2:16.2	said Māra the Wicked,	NA
snp1.2:16.3	“Cattle also bring you delight!	NA
snp1.2:16.4	For attachments are a man’s delight;	NA
snp1.2:16.5	without attachments there’s no delight.”	NA
snp1.2:17.1	“Your children bring you sorrow,”	NA
snp1.2:17.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp1.2:17.3	“Your cattle also bring you sorrow.	NA
snp1.2:17.4	For attachments are a man’s sorrow;	NA
snp1.2:17.5	without attachments there are no sorrows.”	NA

snp1.4:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 1.4	NA
snp1.4:0.2	With Bhāradvāja the Farmer	NA
snp1.4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp1.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa.	NA
snp1.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing.	NA
snp1.4:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working.	NA
snp1.4:1.5	Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food.	NA
snp1.4:1.6	Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side.	NA
snp1.4:2.1	Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms	NA
snp1.4:2.2	and said to him,	NA
snp1.4:2.3	“I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat.	NA
snp1.4:2.4	You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.”	NA
snp1.4:3.1	“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.”	NA
snp1.4:3.2	“I don’t see the worthy Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says:	NA
snp1.4:3.4	‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’”	NA
snp1.4:4.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp1.4:5.1	“You claim to be a farmer,	NA
snp1.4:5.2	but I don’t see you farming.	NA
snp1.4:5.3	Tell me your farming when asked,	NA
snp1.4:5.4	so I can recognize your farming.”	NA
snp1.4:6.1	“Faith is my seed, fervor my rain,	NA
snp1.4:6.2	and wisdom is my yoke and plough.	NA
snp1.4:6.3	Conscience is my pole, mind my strap,	NA
snp1.4:6.4	mindfulness my plowshare and goad.	NA
snp1.4:7.1	Guarded in body and speech,	NA
snp1.4:7.2	I restrict my intake of food.	NA
snp1.4:7.3	I use truth as my scythe,	NA
snp1.4:7.4	and sweetness is my release.	NA
snp1.4:8.1	Energy is my beast of burden,	NA
snp1.4:8.2	transporting me to sanctuary from the yoke.	NA
snp1.4:8.3	It goes without turning back	NA
snp1.4:8.4	where there is no sorrow.	NA
snp1.4:9.1	That’s how to do the farming	NA
snp1.4:9.2	that has freedom from death as its fruit.	NA
snp1.4:9.3	When you finish this farming	NA
snp1.4:9.4	you’re released from all suffering.”	NA
snp1.4:10.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer poured milk-rice in a large bronze cup and presented it to the Buddha:	NA
snp1.4:10.2	“May the worthy Gotama eat the milk-rice!	NA
snp1.4:10.3	The worthy one is a farmer.	NA
snp1.4:10.4	For the worthy Gotama does the farming that has freedom from death as its fruit.”	NA
snp1.4:11.1	“Food enchanted by a verse isn’t fit for me to eat.	NA
snp1.4:11.2	That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin.	NA
snp1.4:11.3	The Buddhas reject things enchanted with verses.	NA
snp1.4:11.4	Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live.	NA
snp1.4:12.1	Serve with other food and drink	NA
snp1.4:12.2	the consummate one, the great seer,	NA
snp1.4:12.3	with defilements ended and remorse stilled.	NA
snp1.4:12.4	For he is the field for the seeker of merit.”	NA
snp1.4:13.1	“Then, worthy Gotama, to whom should I give the milk-rice?”	NA
snp1.4:13.2	“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest this milk-rice, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples.	NA
snp1.4:13.3	Well then, brahmin, throw out the milk-rice where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.”	NA
snp1.4:14.1	So Bhāradvāja the Farmer dropped the milk-rice in water that had no living creatures.	NA
snp1.4:14.2	And when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.	NA
snp1.4:14.3	Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming.	NA
snp1.4:14.4	In the same way, when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming.	NA
snp1.4:15.1	Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer, shocked and awestruck,  went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	NA
snp1.4:15.2	“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent!	NA
snp1.4:15.3	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
snp1.4:15.4	I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
snp1.4:15.5	May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?”	NA
snp1.4:16.1	And Bhāradvāja the Farmer received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
snp1.4:16.2	Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
snp1.4:16.3	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
snp1.4:16.4	And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected.	NA

snp1.5:1.5	how many ascetics are there in the world?”	NA
snp1.5:2.1	“There are four ascetics, not a fifth.”	NA
snp1.5:2.2	said the Buddha to Cunda,	NA
snp1.5:2.3	“Being asked to bear witness, <j>I will explain them to you:	_Sakkhipuṭṭho_ is only elsewhere used in the context of being asked to bear witness in court. I think the context is relevant here, as the Buddha is offering personal testimony on a matter that otherwise he may not speak.

snp1.5:3.3	“and how is one an unequaled explainer of the path?	NA

snp1.5:3.5	then declare the path-wrecker.”	NA
snp1.5:4.1	“Rid of indecision, free of thorns,	NA
snp1.5:4.2	delighting in extinguishment, not fawning,	NA

snp1.6:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp1.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
snp1.6:1.3	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.	NA
snp1.6:1.4	Standing to one side, that deity addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp1.6:2.1	“We ask Gotama	Several of the examples are gendered so I use “man”.
snp1.6:2.2	about a man’s downfall.	NA
snp1.6:2.3	We have come to ask you, sir:	Accept variant _bhavantaṁ_ in this and similar passages. _Bhagavantaṁ_ is hypermetrical.
snp1.6:2.4	what leads to downfall?”	“Cause” or “reason” are not wrong, but they miss the force of the metaphor, which is about going from one state to another.

It appears also in early Sanskrit, for example, for those who are “skilled” in recitation (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.8.1), or for those who only think that they are skilled (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.4.2.1, 4, and 13).

snp1.10:0.2	With Āḷavaka	NA
snp1.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp1.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī in the haunt of the native spirit Āḷavaka.	NA
snp1.10:1.3	Then the native spirit Āḷavaka went up to the Buddha, and said to him:	NA
snp1.10:1.4	“Get out, ascetic!”	NA
snp1.10:1.5	Saying, “All right, good sir,” the Buddha went out.	NA
snp1.10:1.6	“Get in, ascetic!”	NA
snp1.10:1.7	Saying, “All right, good sir,” the Buddha went in.	NA
snp1.10:2.1	For a second time …	NA
snp1.10:2.2	And for a third time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha,	NA
snp1.10:2.3	“Get out, ascetic!”	NA
snp1.10:2.4	Saying, “All right, good sir,” the Buddha went out.	NA
snp1.10:2.5	“Get in, ascetic!”	NA
snp1.10:2.6	Saying, “All right, good sir,” the Buddha went in.	NA
snp1.10:3.1	And for a fourth time the native spirit Āḷavaka said to the Buddha,	NA
snp1.10:3.2	“Get out, ascetic!”	NA
snp1.10:3.3	“No, good sir, I won’t get out.	NA
snp1.10:3.4	Do what you must.”	NA
snp1.10:4.1	“I will ask you a question, ascetic.	NA
snp1.10:4.2	If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!”	NA

snp1.10:5.2	But anyway, ask what you wish.”	NA
snp1.10:5.3	Then the native spirit Āḷavaka addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA

The commentary explains that _amara_ here is “immortality”, and the phrase means “fervent mortification aimed at immortality”. However, I find this unconvincing, one reason being that _amara_ is an adjective (and thus must be glossed with an abstract noun in dative, _amarabhāvatthāya_). It is simpler to assume Pali has an idiomatic sense of _amara_ as “endless”, which occurs here, in the phrase _amarāvikkhepa_ ([dn1:2.23.1]()), and in the Niddesa’s _amarāvitakka_ ([cnd12:6.1]()). Then _amarā_ and _bahū_ are synonyms. I cannot find any use in Sanskrit that parallels this, but _amara_ is noted by Edgerton in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit as “a high number”.

snp2.5:1.3	Now at that time the native spirits Shaggy and Spiky were passing by not far from the Buddha.	NA
snp2.5:1.4	So Shaggy said to Spiky,	NA
snp2.5:1.5	“That’s an ascetic.”	NA
snp2.5:1.6	“That’s no ascetic, he’s a faker!	NA
snp2.5:1.7	I’ll soon find out whether he’s an ascetic or a faker.”	NA
snp2.5:2.1	Then Spiky went up to the Buddha and leaned up against his body,	NA
snp2.5:2.2	but the Buddha pulled away.	NA
snp2.5:2.3	Then Spiky said to the Buddha,	NA
snp2.5:2.4	“Are you afraid, ascetic?”	NA
snp2.5:2.5	“No, good sir, I’m not afraid.	NA
snp2.5:2.6	But your touch is nasty.”	NA
snp2.5:3.1	“I will ask you a question, ascetic.	NA
snp2.5:3.2	If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!”	NA
snp2.5:4.1	“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me.	NA
snp2.5:4.2	But anyway, ask what you wish.”	NA
snp2.5:4.3	Then Spiky addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp2.5:5.1	“Where do greed and hate come from?	NA

snp2.6:0.2	A Righteous Life	NA
snp2.6:1.1	A righteous life, a spiritual life,	The titles Dhammacariyasutta and Kapilasutta are both found in manuscripts and commentary. In the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, Dhammacariyasutta is attested both in the concluding title for the sutta and in the summary verse for this chapter ([snp2.14:31.3]()), while Kapilasutta is attested in the summary verse of the sutta Nipāta as a whole ([snp5.19:22.2](); neither BJT nor PTS has any equivalent for this section so it is probably a late Burmese addition). The BJT has Kapilasutta throughout, while PTS has Dhammacariyasutta throughout, acknowledging Kapilasutta only for the commentary. Given that _kapila_ does not occur in the sutta itself, while _dhammacariya_ occurs in the first line, most likely _kapila_ made its way into the title by contamination from the commentary, which tells an extensive story of a bad monk named Kapila, who the Buddha interrogates after he is reborn as a fish. The Vinaya also knows a monk of dubious morals named Kapila [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:7.48.1]().

snp2.7:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:	NA

snp2.12:0.2	Vaṅgīsa and His Mentor Nigrodhakappa	NA
snp2.12:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp2.12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine.	NA
snp2.12:1.3	Now at that time it was not long after Venerable Vaṅgīsa’s mentor, the senior monk named Nigrodhakappa, had become fully quenched.	NA
snp2.12:1.4	Then as Vaṅgīsa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	NA
snp2.12:1.5	“Has my mentor become quenched or not?”	NA
snp2.12:1.6	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Vaṅgīsa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
snp2.12:1.7	“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.	NA
snp2.12:1.8	‘Has my mentor become quenched or not?’”	NA
snp2.12:1.9	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and addressed him in verse:	NA
snp2.12:2.1	“I ask the teacher unrivaled in wisdom,	NA
snp2.12:2.2	who has cut off all doubts in this very life:	NA
snp2.12:2.3	a monk has died at Aggāḷava, who was	NA
snp2.12:2.4	well-known, famous, and quenched.	NA
snp2.12:3.1	Nigrodhakappa was his name;	NA
snp2.12:3.2	it was given to that brahmin by you, Blessed One.	NA
snp2.12:3.3	He wandered in your honor, yearning for freedom,	NA
snp2.12:3.4	energetic, a resolute Seer of Truth.	NA
snp2.12:4.1	O Sakyan, All-seer,	NA
snp2.12:4.2	we all wish to know about that disciple.	NA
snp2.12:4.3	Our ears are eager to hear,	NA
snp2.12:4.4	for you are the most excellent teacher.	NA
snp2.12:5.1	Cut off our doubt, declare this to us;	NA
snp2.12:5.2	your wisdom is vast, tell us of his quenching!	NA
snp2.12:5.3	All-seer, speak among us,	NA
snp2.12:5.4	like the thousand-eyed Sakka <j>in the midst of the gods!	NA

snp2.12:7.2	like the wind dispersing the clouds,	NA
snp2.12:7.3	darkness would shroud the whole world;	NA

snp2.12:8.1	The attentive are bringers of light;	NA
snp2.12:8.2	my hero, that is what I think of you.	NA
snp2.12:8.3	We’ve come for your discernment and knowledge:	NA
snp2.12:8.4	here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana.	NA
snp2.12:9.1	Swiftly send forth your sweet, sweet voice,	NA
snp2.12:9.2	like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking,	NA
snp2.12:9.3	lucid-flowing, with lovely tone:	NA
snp2.12:9.4	alert, we all listen to you.	NA
snp2.12:10.1	You have entirely abandoned birth and death;	NA
snp2.12:10.2	restrained and pure, I urge you to speak the Dhamma!	NA
snp2.12:10.3	For while ordinary people have no wish-granter,	_Kāmakāro_: “wish-granter”. Ordinary people cannot simply get what they want.
snp2.12:10.4	Realized Ones have a comprehensibility-granter.	_Saṅkheyyakāro_: “comprehensibility-granter”. _Saṅkheyya_ is “calculable, comprehensible”, not “after comprehension”. The Buddha has a gift for explaining things in a way that makes them comprehensible.
snp2.12:11.1	Your answer is definitive, and we will adopt it,	NA
snp2.12:11.2	for you have perfect understanding.	NA
snp2.12:11.3	We raise our joined palms one last time,	NA

snp2.12:12.2	unrivaled hero, don’t deliberately confuse us.	NA
snp2.12:12.3	As a man baking in the summer sun <j>would long for water,	NA
snp2.12:12.4	I long for your voice, so let the sound rain  forth.	NA
snp2.12:13.1	Surely Kappāyana did not <j>lead the spiritual life in vain?	NA
snp2.12:13.2	Did he realize quenching,	NA
snp2.12:13.3	or did he still have a residue?	NA

snp2.14:15.1	Should they converse with a disciple,	NA
snp2.14:15.2	with anyone else, or with a mendicant,	NA
snp2.14:15.3	they’d bring up only the sublime teaching,	NA
snp2.14:15.4	not dividing or blaming.	NA
snp2.14:16.1	For some contend in debate,	NA

snp2.14:17.3	after hearing the teaching of the Holy One,	NA
snp2.14:17.4	a disciple of splendid wisdom <j>would use these after appraisal.	NA
snp2.14:18.1	That’s why, when it comes to alms and lodgings,	NA
snp2.14:18.2	and water for rinsing the dust from the cloak,	NA
snp2.14:18.3	a mendicant is unsullied in the midst of these things,	NA
snp2.14:18.4	like a droplet on a lotus-leaf.	NA
snp2.14:19.1	Now I shall tell you the householder’s duty,	NA

snp2.14:20.4	frail or firm that there are in the world.	NA
snp2.14:21.1	Next, a disciple would avoid knowingly	NA
snp2.14:21.2	taking anything not given at all,	NA

snp3.2:5.3	These are the verses Māra spoke	NA
snp3.2:5.4	as he stood beside the Buddha.	NA
snp3.2:6.1	When Māra had spoken in this way,	NA
snp3.2:6.2	the Buddha said this:	NA
snp3.2:6.3	“O Wicked One, kinsman of the negligent,	NA
snp3.2:6.4	you’re here for your own purpose.	NA

snp3.3:0.2	Well-Spoken Words	NA
snp3.3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
snp3.3:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
snp3.3:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
snp3.3:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
snp3.3:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
snp3.3:2.1	“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.	NA
snp3.3:2.2	What four?	NA
snp3.3:2.3	It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely.	NA
snp3.3:2.4	Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.”	NA
snp3.3:2.5	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
snp3.3:2.6	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
snp3.3:3.1	“Good people say well-spoken words are foremost;	NA
snp3.3:3.2	second, speak on the teaching, not against it;	NA
snp3.3:3.3	third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly;	NA
snp3.3:3.4	and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.”	NA
snp3.3:4.1	Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,	NA
snp3.3:4.2	“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”	NA
snp3.3:4.3	“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.	NA
snp3.3:4.4	Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	NA
snp3.3:5.1	“Speak only such words	NA
snp3.3:5.2	that do not hurt yourself	NA
snp3.3:5.3	nor harm others;	NA
snp3.3:5.4	such speech is truly well spoken.	NA
snp3.3:6.1	Speak only pleasing words,	NA
snp3.3:6.2	words gladly welcomed.	NA
snp3.3:6.3	Pleasing words are those	NA
snp3.3:6.4	that bring nothing bad to others.	NA
snp3.3:7.1	Truth itself is the undying word:	NA
snp3.3:7.2	this is an ancient teaching.	NA
snp3.3:7.3	Good people say that the teaching and its meaning	NA
snp3.3:7.4	are grounded in the truth.	NA
snp3.3:8.1	The words spoken by the Buddha	NA
snp3.3:8.2	for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment,	NA
snp3.3:8.3	for the attainment of vision,	NA
snp3.3:8.4	this really is the best kind of speech.”	NA
snp3.4:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 3.4	NA
snp3.4:0.2	With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake	NA
snp3.4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river.	This Sutta is a somewhat altered version of [sn7.9](). It contains a range of dense allusions and plays on Vedic concepts.
snp3.4:1.3	Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā.	This is evidently the midday fire oblation described at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.3. A brahmin householder, worshiping when the sun is at its most powerful and the forces of darkness weakest, renders offerings to Agni so that he will drive away evils.
snp3.4:1.4	Then he surveyed the four quarters, wondering,	NA
snp3.4:1.5	“Now who might eat the leftovers of this oblation?”	NA
snp3.4:1.6	He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head.	NA
snp3.4:1.7	Taking the leftovers of the oblation in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha.	NA
snp3.4:2.1	When he heard Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head.	NA
snp3.4:2.2	Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back.	NA
snp3.4:2.3	But he thought,	NA
snp3.4:2.4	“Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?”	NA
snp3.4:2.5	Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
snp3.4:2.6	“Sir, what are you by birth?”	NA
snp3.4:3.1	Then the Buddha addressed Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā in verse:	NA
snp3.4:4.1	“I am no brahmin, nor am I a ruler,	Here _rājaputta_ is a synonym of _khattiya_.
snp3.4:4.2	nor peasant nor anything else.	NA
snp3.4:4.3	Fully understanding the clan of ordinary people,	NA
snp3.4:4.4	I wander in the world owning nothing, reflective.	NA
snp3.4:5.1	Clad in my cloak, I wander without home,	NA
snp3.4:5.2	my hair shorn, quenched.	NA
snp3.4:5.3	Since I’m unburdened by the sons of Manu,	_Māṇava_, which normally means “Vedic student”, is occasionally used in the poetic sense of _manussa_ (“humans”). Both words mean “descendant of the first man, Manu”. The Buddha, it would seem, is playing on the two senses. Normally, having Vedic students is an honor for a teacher, but here the Buddha celebrates his freedom.
snp3.4:5.4	it’s inappropriate to ask me about clan.”	NA
snp3.4:6.1	“Actually sir, when brahmins meet they politely	NA
snp3.4:6.2	ask each other whether they are brahmins.”	NA
snp3.4:7.1	“Well, if you say that you’re a brahmin,	NA
snp3.4:7.2	and that I am not,	NA
snp3.4:7.3	I shall question you on the Sāvitrī Mantra,	The Buddha is demonstrating his expertise. The verse here called Sāvittī (Sanskrit Sāvitrī) may be recited in Gāyatrī or Anuṣṭubh metres. The form specified here is the Gāyatrī, which is the form recommended for the initiation of a student in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14), and probably represents the lineage practiced by Siddhattha under his former teachers.
snp3.4:7.4	with its three lines and twenty-four syllables.”	NA
snp3.4:8.1	“On what grounds have seers and men,	NA
snp3.4:8.2	aristocrats and brahmins here in the world	NA
snp3.4:8.3	performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?”	NA
snp3.4:9.1	“During a sacrifice, should a past-master, <j>a knowledge master,	NA
snp3.4:9.2	receive an oblation, it profits the donor, I say.”	NA
snp3.4:10.1	“Then clearly my oblation will be profitable,”	NA
snp3.4:10.2	said the brahmin,	NA
snp3.4:10.3	“since I have met such a knowledge master.	NA
snp3.4:10.4	It’s because I’d never met anyone like you	NA
snp3.4:10.5	that others ate the sacrificial cake.”	The _pūraḷāsa_ (Sanskrit _puroḍāśa_) is the “fore-offering”, which originally might be the goat that is led before the horse to the sacrifice (Rig Veda 1.162.3). The reference here, however, is to the cakes of rice-meal steeped in ghee that are offered to Agni (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.2.3.14).
snp3.4:11.1	“So then, brahmin, since you have approached me	NA
snp3.4:11.2	as a seeker of the good, ask.	Norman and Bodhi both have “approach and ask”, but _upasaṅkamma_ is absolutive: he is already there.
snp3.4:11.3	Perhaps you may find here someone intelligent,	NA
snp3.4:11.4	peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope.”	NA
snp3.4:12.1	“Worthy Gotama, I like to sacrifice	NA
snp3.4:12.2	and wish to perform a sacrifice. Please advise me,	NA
snp3.4:12.3	for I do not understand	NA
snp3.4:12.4	where an oblation is profitable; tell me this.”	NA
snp3.4:13.1	“Well then, brahmin, listen up, I will teach you the Dhamma.	NA
snp3.4:14.1	Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct;	NA
snp3.4:14.2	for the fire of Jātaveda is born from sticks.	The line plays with _jāti_ (“birth”), _jāyati_ (“give birth”), and _jātaveda_. The latter term is a Vedic word for fire. Its meaning is obscure, but I think the sense is _jāta_ (“those who have been born”, i.e. “mortals”) plus _vedas_ (“knowledge”), i.e. “one who brings knowledge to mortals”. This is the fire-god Agni, who comes down from the sun to the sacrificial fire, bringing light and awareness and Vedic knowledge to those who have been born, namely mortal humans. In this passage, it implies that anyone who “has been born” can “give birth” to “knowledge” regardless of their “birth”.

snp3.4:35.1	“One who is rid of aggression,	This does not seem entirely coherent, as the Buddha just rejected such food, although it is perhaps not a direct contradiction. But compare [sn7.9:9.2](), where the Buddha says enchanted food should be discarded.

snp3.4:39.6	And the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA

snp3.5:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 3.5	NA
snp3.5:0.2	With Māgha	NA
snp3.5:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.	NA
snp3.5:1.3	Then the student Māgha approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	Māgha (“bounteous one”) is from the Vedic word _magha_, “gift, bounty”. It is a name of Sakka ([sn2.3]()), as is the synonymous Maghavā ([sn11.12:1.3](), [sn11.13:6.1]()). The good king of [mn83]() is named Maghadeva, “god of bounty”.
snp3.5:1.4	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
snp3.5:1.5	and said to the Buddha:	NA
snp3.5:2.1	“I’m a giver, worthy Gotama, a donor; I am bountiful and committed to charity.	NA
snp3.5:2.2	I seek wealth in a principled manner,	NA
snp3.5:2.3	and with that legitimate wealth I give to one person, to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred people or even more.	NA
snp3.5:2.4	Giving and sacrificing like this, worthy Gotama, do I accrue much merit?”	NA
snp3.5:3.1	“Indeed you do, student.	NA
snp3.5:3.2	A giver or donor who is bountiful and committed to charity,	NA
snp3.5:3.3	who seeks wealth in a principled manner,	NA
snp3.5:3.4	and with that legitimate wealth gives to one person, or up to a hundred people or even more, accrues much merit.”	NA
snp3.5:3.5	Then Māgha addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp3.5:4.1	“I ask the bountiful Gotama,”	NA
snp3.5:4.2	said Māgha,	NA
snp3.5:4.3	“wearing an ochre robe, wandering homeless.	NA
snp3.5:4.4	Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity	NA
snp3.5:4.5	makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit.	NA

snp3.5:4.7	how is their offering purifed?”	NA
snp3.5:5.1	“Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity,”	NA
snp3.5:5.2	replied the Buddha,	NA
snp3.5:5.3	“makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit,	NA
snp3.5:5.4	giving food and drink to others here:	NA
snp3.5:5.5	such a one would succeed due to those <j>who are worthy of donations.”	Bodhi translates _ārādhaye_ as simple present tense here (“succeeds”) and in the identical line below as imperative (“should accomplish”). Norman has the optative mood in both cases, which is surely correct.
snp3.5:6.1	“Suppose a lay donor who is committed to charity,”	NA
snp3.5:6.2	said Māgha,	NA
snp3.5:6.3	“makes a sacrifice seeking merit, looking for merit,	NA

snp3.5:24.1	“Sacrifice, and while doing so,”	The “speaker’s mark” is in MS treated as part of the line, which is unusual if not unique. According to Norman’s note here however, we should consider this line a seven-syllable sloka (perhaps restoring the variant _ca_ to make it eight). I have adjusted the Pali punctuation accordingly.
snp3.5:24.2	replied the Buddha,	NA
snp3.5:24.3	“be clear and confident in every way.	NA

snp3.5:26.1	“Who is purified, freed, awake?	_Bajjhati_ (“bound”) seems odd to me in this line. I think it’s more likely these are three semi-synonyms. As it stands, the Buddha does not actually answer the question, since he only discusses the positive side. PTS notes a reading _bujjhati_ in the commentary, which I follow. However the commentary reads _bajjhati_ in the VRI edition, and the comment itself supports this, since it treats it as a bad thing. If it is a mistake, then, it is an old one.

snp3.6:1.3	Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with several questions by a deity who was a former blood relation, saying:	NA
snp3.6:1.4	“Sabhiya, you should live the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers these questions.”	NA
snp3.6:2.1	Then Sabhiya, after learning those questions in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is,	NA
snp3.6:2.2	Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan.	NA
snp3.6:2.3	And he asked them those questions,	NA
snp3.6:2.4	but they were stumped by them.	NA
snp3.6:2.5	Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,	NA
snp3.6:2.6	they questioned Sabhiya in return.	NA
snp3.6:3.1	Then Sabhiya thought,	NA
snp3.6:3.2	“Those famous ascetics and brahmins	NA
snp3.6:3.4	were stumped by my questions.	NA
snp3.6:3.5	Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,	NA
snp3.6:3.6	they questioned me in return on that matter.	NA
snp3.6:3.7	Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?”	NA
snp3.6:4.1	Then Sabhiya thought,	NA
snp3.6:4.2	“This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people.	NA
snp3.6:4.3	Why don’t I ask him this question?”	NA
snp3.6:5.1	Then he thought,	NA
snp3.6:5.2	“Even those ascetics and brahmins who are elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; who are senior, long standing, long gone forth; who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community; who are well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people—that is	NA
snp3.6:5.3	Pūraṇa Kassapa and the rest—	NA
snp3.6:5.4	were stumped by my questions.	NA
snp3.6:5.5	They displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return.	NA
snp3.6:5.6	How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my questions,	NA
snp3.6:5.7	since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?”	NA
snp3.6:6.1	Then he thought,	NA
snp3.6:6.2	“An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.	NA
snp3.6:6.3	Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?”	NA
snp3.6:7.1	Then Sabhiya set out for Rājagaha.	NA
snp3.6:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he came to Rājagaha, the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
snp3.6:7.3	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,	NA
snp3.6:7.4	and addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp3.6:8.1	“I’ve come full of  doubts and uncertainties,”	NA
snp3.6:8.2	said Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:8.3	“wishing to ask some questions.	NA
snp3.6:8.4	Please solve them for me.	NA
snp3.6:8.5	Answer my questions in turn, <j>in accordance with the truth.”	NA
snp3.6:9.1	“You have come from afar, Sabhiya,”	NA
snp3.6:9.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp3.6:9.3	“wishing to ask some questions.	NA
snp3.6:9.4	I shall solve them for you,	NA
snp3.6:9.5	answering your questions in turn, <j>in accordance with the truth.	NA
snp3.6:10.1	Ask me your question, Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:10.2	whatever you want.	NA
snp3.6:10.3	I’ll solve each and every	NA
snp3.6:10.4	question you have.”	NA
snp3.6:11.1	Then Sabhiya thought,	NA
snp3.6:11.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
snp3.6:11.3	Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.”	NA
snp3.6:11.4	Uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, he asked this question.	NA
snp3.6:12.1	“What must one attain to be called a mendicant?”	NA
snp3.6:12.2	said Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:12.3	“How is one ‘sweet’, how said to be ‘tamed’?	NA
snp3.6:12.4	How is one declared to be ‘awakened’?	NA
snp3.6:12.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”	NA
snp3.6:13.1	“When by the path they have walked themselves,”	NA
snp3.6:13.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:13.3	“they reach extinguishment, with doubt overcome;	NA
snp3.6:13.4	giving up desire to continue existence or to end it,	NA
snp3.6:13.5	their journey complete, their rebirths ended: <j>that is a mendicant.	NA
snp3.6:14.1	Equanimous towards everything, mindful,	NA
snp3.6:14.2	they don’t harm anyone in the world.	NA
snp3.6:14.3	An ascetic who has crossed over, unclouded,	NA
snp3.6:14.4	who has no pretensions, is sweet-natured.	NA
snp3.6:15.1	Their faculties have been developed	NA
snp3.6:15.2	inside and out in the whole world.	NA
snp3.6:15.3	Having pierced through this world and the next,	NA
snp3.6:15.4	tamed, they await their time.	NA
snp3.6:16.1	They have examined the eons in their entirety,	The Commentary allows _kappa_ in the sense of both “mental activity” and “eon” here. The context in this verse suggests it is about the eons of transmigration.
snp3.6:16.2	and both sides of transmigration—<j>passing away and rebirth.	NA
snp3.6:16.3	Rid of dust, unblemished, purified:	NA
snp3.6:16.4	the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained <j>the end of rebirth.”	NA
snp3.6:17.1	And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question:	NA
snp3.6:18.1	“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?”	NA
snp3.6:18.2	said Sabhiya.	NA
snp3.6:18.3	“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’?	NA
snp3.6:18.4	How is one declared to be a ‘giant’?	NA
snp3.6:18.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”	NA
snp3.6:19.1	“Having banished all bad things,”	NA
snp3.6:19.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:19.3	“immaculate, well-composed, steadfast,	NA
snp3.6:19.4	consummate, they’ve left transmigration behind:	NA
snp3.6:19.5	unattached, one such is called ‘brahmin’.	Commentary glosses _brahmā_ with _brāhmaṇa_, which is required by the sense.
snp3.6:20.1	An assuaged one who has given up good and evil,	NA
snp3.6:20.2	stainless, understanding this world and the next,	NA
snp3.6:20.3	gone beyond rebirth and death:	NA
snp3.6:20.4	one such is rightly called ‘ascetic’.	NA
snp3.6:21.1	Having washed off all bad things	NA
snp3.6:21.2	inside and out in the whole world,	NA
snp3.6:21.3	among gods and humans bound to creations,	NA
snp3.6:21.4	the one they call ‘washed’ does not return to creation.	NA
snp3.6:22.1	They do nothing monstrous at all in the world,	NA
snp3.6:22.2	discarding all yokes and bonds,	NA
snp3.6:22.3	everywhere not stuck, freed:	NA
snp3.6:22.4	one such is rightly called ‘giant’.”	NA
snp3.6:23.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question:	NA
snp3.6:24.1	“Who is a ‘field-victor’ according to the Buddhas?”	I think Norman’s reconstruction of this to root _ñā_ (followed by Bodhi) is too speculative. The word makes fine sense as is, and is more metaphorically connected with the sense of _khetta_.
snp3.6:24.2	said Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:24.3	“Why is one ‘skillful’, and how ‘a wise scholar’?	NA
snp3.6:24.4	How is one declared to be a ‘sage’?	NA
snp3.6:24.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”	NA
snp3.6:25.1	“They are victors on the fields of deeds in their entirety,”	Reading _vijeyya_; both _viceyya_ and _vijeyya_ are accepted in the commentary. The “fields” are the “fields of deeds” ([an3.77:2.3]()).
snp3.6:25.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:25.3	“the fields of gods, humans, and divinitiess;	NA
snp3.6:25.4	released from the root bondage to all fields:	NA
snp3.6:25.5	one such is rightly called ‘field-victor’.	NA
snp3.6:26.1	They have examined the coffers in their entirety,	NA
snp3.6:26.2	the coffers of gods, humans, and divinitiess;	NA
snp3.6:26.3	released from the root bondage to all coffers:	NA
snp3.6:26.4	one such is rightly called ‘skillful’.	NA
snp3.6:27.1	They have examined whiteness	_Paṇḍarāni_ means not “senses” per commentary, but is a synonym for _suddhi_ in the next line. A true _paṇḍita_ is pure both inside and out.
snp3.6:27.2	both inside and out; understanding purity,	NA
snp3.6:27.3	they have left dark and bright behind:	NA
snp3.6:27.4	one such is rightly called ‘a wise scholar’.”	NA
snp3.6:28.1	Understanding the nature of the bad and the good	NA
snp3.6:28.2	inside and out in the whole world;	NA
snp3.6:28.3	one worthy of honor by gods and humans,	NA
snp3.6:28.4	who has escaped from the net and the snare: <j>that is a sage.”	NA
snp3.6:29.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question:	NA
snp3.6:30.1	“What must one attain <j>to be called ‘knowledge master’?”	NA
snp3.6:30.2	said Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:30.3	“Why is one ‘studied’, and how is one ‘heroic’?	NA
snp3.6:30.4	How to gain the name ‘thoroughbred’?	NA
snp3.6:30.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”	NA
snp3.6:31.1	“They have examined knowledges in their entirety,”	NA
snp3.6:31.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:31.3	“those that are current among ascetics and brahmins;	NA
snp3.6:31.4	rid of greed for all feelings,	NA
snp3.6:31.5	having left all knowledges behind: <j>that is a knowledge master.	NA
snp3.6:32.1	Having studied proliferation and name & form	NA
snp3.6:32.2	inside and out—the root of disease;	NA
snp3.6:32.3	released from the root bondage to all disease:	NA
snp3.6:32.4	one such is rightly called ‘studied’.	NA
snp3.6:33.1	Refraining from all evil here,	NA
snp3.6:33.2	heroic, he escapes from the suffering of hell;	The commentary’s “abode of energy” for _viriyavāso_ doesn’t sound right to me, though followed by Bodhi and Norman. I read _viriyavā so_.
snp3.6:33.3	he is heroic and energetic:	NA
snp3.6:33.4	one such is rightly called ‘hero’.	Reading _vīro_.
snp3.6:34.1	Whoever’s bonds are cut,	NA
snp3.6:34.2	the root of clinging inside and out;	NA
snp3.6:34.3	released from the root bondage to all clinging:	NA
snp3.6:34.4	one such is rightly called ‘thoroughbred’.”	NA
snp3.6:35.1	And then Sabhiya asked another question:	NA
snp3.6:36.1	“What must one attain to be called ‘scholar’?”	NA
snp3.6:36.2	said Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:36.3	“Why is one ‘noble’, and how is one ‘well conducted’?	NA
snp3.6:36.4	How to gain the name ‘wanderer’?	NA
snp3.6:36.5	May the Buddha please answer my question.”	NA
snp3.6:37.1	“One who has learned every teaching,”	The absolutives _sutvā_ and _abhiññāya_ apply to their respective following accusatives _sabbadhammaṁ_ and _sāvajjānavajjaṁ_.
snp3.6:37.2	said the Buddha to Sabhiya,	NA
snp3.6:37.3	“and has known for themselves what in the world <j>is blameworthy and blameless;	NA
snp3.6:37.4	a champion, decided, liberated,	NA
snp3.6:37.5	untroubled everywhere: they call them ‘scholar’.	NA
snp3.6:38.1	Having cut off defilements and clingings,	Here _ālaya_ (“clinging”) is punned with _ariya_ (“noble”). See [mn39:28.1]().
snp3.6:38.2	being wise, they enter no womb.	NA
snp3.6:38.3	They’ve expelled the bog of the three perceptions,	The three perceptions are sensuality, malice, and cruelty. Since _paṅka_ is  a stock metaphor for _kāma_, it seems we should read “the bog of the three perceptions” rather than “the three perceptions and the bog”.
snp3.6:38.4	the one they call ‘noble’ does not return to creation.	NA
snp3.6:39.1	One here who is accomplished <j>and skillful in all forms of good conduct;	The syntax reads more cleanly if the nominatives in this line and the next are read together; and the clauses following _sabb-_ are likewise read in parallel.
snp3.6:39.2	always understanding the teaching,	NA
snp3.6:39.3	everywhere not stuck, freed in mind,	NA
snp3.6:39.4	who has no repulsion: they are ‘well-conducted’.	NA
snp3.6:40.1	They wander full of wisdom,	NA
snp3.6:40.2	having banished any deed that results in suffering,	NA
snp3.6:40.3	deceit and conceit, as well as greed and anger,	NA
snp3.6:40.4	above, below, all round, between.	NA
snp3.6:40.5	They have made a limit on name & form;	_Pariyanta_ means “limit, boundary”. An arahant still has name & form, but only until the end of their life.
snp3.6:40.6	the one they call a ‘wanderer’ <j>has reached their destination.”	I think _pattipatta_ is a play on words here.
snp3.6:41.1	And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	NA
snp3.6:42.1	“O one of vast wisdom, <j>there are three & sixty opinions	These are the sixty-two views of the Brahmajālasutta. The view of self underlies them all ([sn41.3:4.13]()), and according to the commentary it is here included as the sixty-third.
snp3.6:42.2	based on the doctrines of ascetics:	NA
snp3.6:42.3	they are expressions of perception, <j>based on perception.	NA
snp3.6:42.4	Having dispelled them all, <j>you passed over the dark flood.	NA
snp3.6:43.1	You have gone to the end, gone beyond suffering,	NA
snp3.6:43.2	you are perfected, a fully awakened Buddha; <j>I think you have ended defilements.	NA
snp3.6:43.3	Splendid, intelligent, abounding in wisdom,	NA
snp3.6:43.4	ender of suffering—you brought me across!	NA
snp3.6:44.1	When you understood my uncertainty,	NA
snp3.6:44.2	you brought me beyond doubt—homage to you!	NA
snp3.6:44.3	A sage, accomplished in the ways of sagacity,	NA
snp3.6:44.4	you are gentle, not hardhearted, <j>O kinsman of the Sun.	Oddly, at [an5.38:5.4]() we find _sorata_ with _sakhila_ in a similar sense to _akhila_ here.
snp3.6:45.1	Any doubts that I once had,	NA
snp3.6:45.2	you have answered for me, O Clear-eyed One.	NA
snp3.6:45.3	Clearly you are a sage, an Awakened One,	NA
snp3.6:45.4	there are no hindrances in you.	NA
snp3.6:46.1	All your distress	NA
snp3.6:46.2	is blown away and mown down.	NA
snp3.6:46.3	Cooled, tamed, steadfast:	NA
snp3.6:46.4	truth is your strength.	NA
snp3.6:47.1	O giant among giants, O great hero,	NA
snp3.6:47.2	when you are speaking	NA
snp3.6:47.3	all the gods rejoice,	NA
snp3.6:47.4	including both Nārada and Pabbata.	A rare Pali reference to the legendary sages Nārada and his nephew Parvata, whose story is in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa.
snp3.6:48.1	Homage to you, O thoroughbred!	NA
snp3.6:48.2	Homage to you, supreme among men!	NA
snp3.6:48.3	In the world with its gods,	NA
snp3.6:48.4	you have no rival.	NA
snp3.6:49.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,	NA
snp3.6:49.2	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;	NA
snp3.6:49.3	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,	NA
snp3.6:49.4	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.	NA
snp3.6:50.1	You have transcended attachments,	NA
snp3.6:50.2	your defilements are shattered;	NA
snp3.6:50.3	you are a lion, free of grasping,	NA
snp3.6:50.4	with fear and dread given up.	NA
snp3.6:51.1	Like a graceful lotus	NA
snp3.6:51.2	to which water does not stick,	NA
snp3.6:51.3	so both good and evil	NA
snp3.6:51.4	do not stick to you.	NA
snp3.6:51.5	Stretch out your feet, great hero:	NA
snp3.6:51.6	Sabhiya bows to the Teacher.”	NA
snp3.6:52.1	Then the wanderer Sabhiya bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said,	NA
snp3.6:52.2	“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …	NA
snp3.6:52.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
snp3.6:52.4	Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”	NA
snp3.6:53.1	“Sabhiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.	NA
snp3.6:53.2	However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”	NA
snp3.6:54.1	“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”	NA
snp3.6:54.2	And the wanderer Sabhiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
snp3.6:54.3	And Venerable Sabhiya became one of the perfected.	NA
snp3.7:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 3.7	NA
snp3.7:0.2	With Sela	NA
snp3.7:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans when he arrived at a town of theirs named Āpaṇa.	NA
snp3.7:1.3	The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard:	NA
snp3.7:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	NA
snp3.7:1.5	He has this good reputation:	NA
snp3.7:1.6	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
snp3.7:1.7	He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.	NA
snp3.7:1.8	He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.	NA
snp3.7:1.9	It’s good to see such perfected ones.”	NA
snp3.7:2.1	So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	Keṇiya features also in the Vinaya, where at this point he offered the Buddha and the Sangha a drink in the evening, reasoning that the Brahmanical sages of the past did likewise ([pli-tv-kd6:35.1.2]()). As a result, the Buddha allowed fruit juice and other drinks in the evening.
snp3.7:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
snp3.7:2.3	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	NA
snp3.7:2.4	Then he said to the Buddha,	NA
snp3.7:2.5	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
snp3.7:2.6	When he said this, the Buddha said to him,	NA
snp3.7:2.7	“The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.”	NA
snp3.7:3.1	For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	NA
snp3.7:3.2	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	NA
snp3.7:3.3	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
snp3.7:3.4	And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply.	NA
snp3.7:4.1	For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering.	NA
snp3.7:4.2	“Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins.	NA
snp3.7:4.3	Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”	NA
snp3.7:4.4	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
snp3.7:4.5	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and kin,	NA
snp3.7:4.6	“My friends and colleagues, relatives and kin: please listen!	NA
snp3.7:4.7	The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal.	NA
snp3.7:4.8	Please help me out with the manual preparations.”	“Manual preparations” is _kāyaveyyāvaṭikaṁ_. Ten kinds of service are enumerated in the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 9.24.
snp3.7:4.9	“Yes, worthy sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats.	NA
snp3.7:4.10	Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself.	NA
snp3.7:5.1	Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred young students to recite the hymns.	NA
snp3.7:6.1	And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela.	NA
snp3.7:6.2	Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred young students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage.	NA
snp3.7:6.3	He saw the preparations going on,	NA
snp3.7:6.4	and said to Keṇiya,	NA
snp3.7:6.5	“Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?”	NA
snp3.7:7.1	“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming.	NA
snp3.7:7.2	Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice.	NA
snp3.7:7.3	The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.	NA
snp3.7:7.4	He has this good reputation:	NA
snp3.7:7.5	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
snp3.7:7.6	He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
snp3.7:7.7	“Worthy Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	Anāthapiṇḍika responded in the same way when hearing of the Buddha ([pli-tv-kd16:4.2.10]()). Also compare Bāvari’s elation at [snp5.1:19.1]().
snp3.7:7.8	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	NA
snp3.7:7.9	“Worthy Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?”	NA
snp3.7:7.10	“I said ‘the awakened one’.”	NA
snp3.7:8.1	Then Sela thought,	NA
snp3.7:8.2	“It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world.	NA
snp3.7:8.3	The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.	NA
snp3.7:8.4	If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.	NA
snp3.7:8.5	He has the following seven treasures:	NA
snp3.7:8.6	the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure.	NA
snp3.7:8.7	He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.	NA
snp3.7:8.8	After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.	NA
snp3.7:8.9	But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.	NA
snp3.7:8.10	“But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”	NA
snp3.7:9.1	When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said,	NA
snp3.7:9.2	“There, worthy Sela, at that line of blue forest.”	NA
snp3.7:9.3	Then Sela, together with his young students, approached the Buddha.	NA
snp3.7:9.4	He said to his young students,	NA
snp3.7:9.5	“Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently.	NA
snp3.7:9.6	For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone.	_Durāsada_ (“intimidating”) is also at [an4.42:4.1](), which shows that the sense is that they are hard to defeat in debate.
snp3.7:9.7	When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt.	NA
snp3.7:9.8	Wait until I’ve finished speaking.”	NA
snp3.7:10.1	Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
snp3.7:10.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.	NA
snp3.7:10.3	and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.	NA
snp3.7:10.4	He saw all of them except for two,	NA
snp3.7:10.5	which he had doubts about:	NA
snp3.7:10.6	whether the private parts were covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.	NA
snp3.7:11.1	Then it occurred to the Buddha,	NA
snp3.7:11.2	“Sela sees all the marks except for two,	NA
snp3.7:11.3	which he has doubts about:	NA
snp3.7:11.4	whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.”	NA
snp3.7:11.5	The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin.	NA
snp3.7:11.6	And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.	NA
snp3.7:12.1	Then Sela thought,	NA
snp3.7:12.2	“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.	NA
snp3.7:12.3	But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one.	NA
snp3.7:12.4	I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said,	NA
snp3.7:12.5	‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’	This idea is not found elsewhere in the Pali.
snp3.7:12.6	Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?”	NA
snp3.7:12.7	Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses:	NA
snp3.7:13.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,	NA
snp3.7:13.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;	NA
snp3.7:13.3	golden colored,	NA
snp3.7:13.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.	NA
snp3.7:14.1	The characteristics	NA
snp3.7:14.2	of a handsome man,	NA
snp3.7:14.3	the marks of a great man,	NA
snp3.7:14.4	are all found on your body.	NA
snp3.7:15.1	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,	NA
snp3.7:15.2	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.	NA
snp3.7:15.3	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,	NA
snp3.7:15.4	you shine like the sun.	NA
snp3.7:16.1	You’re a mendicant fine to see,	NA
snp3.7:16.2	with skin that shines like lustrous gold.	NA
snp3.7:16.3	But with such excellent appearance,	NA
snp3.7:16.4	what do you want with the ascetic life?	NA
snp3.7:17.1	You’re fit to be a king,	NA
snp3.7:17.2	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,	NA
snp3.7:17.3	victorious in the four quarters,	NA
snp3.7:17.4	lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.	NA
snp3.7:18.1	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings	NA
snp3.7:18.2	ought follow your rule.	NA
snp3.7:18.3	Gotama, may you reign	NA
snp3.7:18.4	as king of kings, lord of mankind!”	NA
snp3.7:19.1	“I am a king, Sela”,	NA
snp3.7:19.2	said the Buddha,	While the content of the text is identical with [mn92](), the current text has more tags identifying the speakers.
snp3.7:19.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
snp3.7:19.4	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel	NA
snp3.7:19.5	which cannot be rolled back.”	This is of course a reference to the first sermon ([sn56.11]()).
snp3.7:20.1	“You claim to be awakened,”	NA
snp3.7:20.2	said Sela the brahmin,	NA
snp3.7:20.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
snp3.7:20.4	‘I roll forth the teaching’:	NA
snp3.7:20.5	so you say, Gotama.	NA
snp3.7:21.1	Then who is your general,	The title “General of the Dhamma” belongs to Sāriputta ([ud2.8:16.2](), [thag18.1:33.1]()).
snp3.7:21.2	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?	NA
snp3.7:21.3	Who keeps rolling the wheel	NA
snp3.7:21.4	of the teaching you rolled forth?”	NA
snp3.7:22.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”	NA
snp3.7:22.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp3.7:22.3	“the supreme wheel of the teaching.	NA
snp3.7:22.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,	NA
snp3.7:22.5	keeps it rolling on.	_Anujāta_ is said at [iti74:4.1]() to be a child who “takes after” the good qualities of their parents.
snp3.7:23.1	I have known what should be known,	As at [mn91:31.5]().
snp3.7:23.2	and developed what should be developed,	NA
snp3.7:23.3	and given up what should be given up:	NA
snp3.7:23.4	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	NA
snp3.7:24.1	Dispel your doubt in me—	NA
snp3.7:24.2	make up your mind, brahmin!	NA
snp3.7:24.3	The sight of a Buddha	NA
snp3.7:24.4	is hard to find again.	_Abhiṇhaso_ means “repeatedly”. Here the force of the saying is, I think, “It is hard enough to encounter a Buddha even once, let alone repeatedly.”
snp3.7:25.1	I am a Buddha, brahmin,	NA
snp3.7:25.2	the supreme surgeon,	NA
snp3.7:25.3	one of those whose appearance in the world	NA
snp3.7:25.4	is hard to find again.	NA
snp3.7:26.1	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	NA
snp3.7:26.2	crusher of Māra’s army;	NA
snp3.7:26.3	having subdued all my opponents,	NA
snp3.7:26.4	I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.”	NA
snp3.7:27.1	“Pay heed, good fellows, to what	NA
snp3.7:27.2	is spoken by the Clear-eyed One.	NA
snp3.7:27.3	The surgeon, the great hero,	NA
snp3.7:27.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.	NA
snp3.7:28.1	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	NA
snp3.7:28.2	crusher of Māra’s army;	NA
snp3.7:28.3	who would not be inspired by him,	NA
snp3.7:28.4	even one born in a dark class?	The “dark class” refers to those born in an unfortunate state ([an6.57:11.1]()). Sela is saying that the Buddha’s path is for everyone, not just the fortunate.
snp3.7:29.1	Those who wish may follow me;	NA
snp3.7:29.2	those who don’t may go.	NA
snp3.7:29.3	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,	NA
snp3.7:29.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	NA
snp3.7:30.1	“Sir, if you endorse	NA
snp3.7:30.2	the teaching of the Buddha,	NA
snp3.7:30.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,	NA
snp3.7:30.4	the one of such splendid wisdom.”	NA
snp3.7:31.1	“These three hundred brahmins	NA
snp3.7:31.2	with joined palms held up, ask:	NA
snp3.7:31.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life	NA
snp3.7:31.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’”	NA
snp3.7:32.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”	NA
snp3.7:32.2	said the Buddha,	NA
snp3.7:32.3	“apparent in the present life, immediately effective.	NA
snp3.7:32.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain	NA
snp3.7:32.5	for one who trains with diligence.”	NA
snp3.7:33.1	And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.	NA
snp3.7:33.2	And when the night had passed Keṇiya had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own hermitage. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
snp3.7:33.3	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
snp3.7:33.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
snp3.7:34.1	Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
snp3.7:34.2	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
snp3.7:34.3	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	NA
snp3.7:35.1	“The foremost of sacrifices <j>is the offering to the sacred flame;	Here _yaññā_ is a truncated genitive plural (“of sacrifices”).
snp3.7:35.2	the Sāvitrī Mantra <j>is the foremost of poetic meters;	The Sāvitrī (or Gāyatrī) is the “head” of metres (_śiro gāyatryaḥ_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa  8.6.2.3, 8.6.2.6), and was “praised as the foremost of recitations” (_gāyatrāṇy uktha mukhanai śaṁsanti_, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 17.7.1). It was the first verse taught a new initiate (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13).
snp3.7:35.3	of humans, the king is the foremost;	NA
snp3.7:35.4	the ocean’s the foremost of rivers;	NA
snp3.7:36.1	the foremost of stars is the moon;	NA
snp3.7:36.2	the sun is the foremost of lights;	NA
snp3.7:36.3	for those who sacrifice seeking merit,	NA
snp3.7:36.4	the Saṅgha is the foremost.”	NA
snp3.7:37.1	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	NA
snp3.7:37.2	Then Venerable Sela and his assembly, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
snp3.7:37.3	And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected.	NA
snp3.7:38.1	Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:	NA
snp3.7:39.1	“This is the eighth day since	NA
snp3.7:39.2	we went for refuge, O Clear-eyed One.	NA
snp3.7:39.3	In these seven days, Blessed One,	NA
snp3.7:39.4	we’ve become tamed in your teaching.	NA
snp3.7:40.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,	This verse and the next are also at [snp3.6:49.1]().
snp3.7:40.2	you are the sage who has overcome Māra;	NA
snp3.7:40.3	you have cut off the underlying tendencies,	NA
snp3.7:40.4	you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across.	NA
snp3.7:41.1	You have transcended attachments,	NA
snp3.7:41.2	your defilements are shattered;	NA
snp3.7:41.3	you are a lion, free of grasping,	NA
snp3.7:41.4	with fear and dread given up.	NA
snp3.7:42.1	These three hundred mendicants	NA
snp3.7:42.2	stand with joined palms raised.	NA
snp3.7:42.3	Stretch out your feet, great hero:	NA
snp3.7:42.4	let these giants bow to the Teacher.”	NA

snp3.8:0.2	The Dart	NA
snp3.8:1.1	Unforeseen and unknown	A _nimitta_ is a sign or portent, and is commonly used in the context of omens, prophecy, or fortune-telling. Here it means that there is no portent or omen by which one can predict the extent of life.
snp3.8:1.2	is the extent of this mortal life—	NA
snp3.8:1.3	hard and short	NA
snp3.8:1.4	and bound to pain.	NA
snp3.8:2.1	There is no way that	NA
snp3.8:2.2	those born will not die.	NA
snp3.8:2.3	On reaching old age death follows:	NA
snp3.8:2.4	such is the nature of living creatures.	NA
snp3.8:3.1	As ripe fruit	NA
snp3.8:3.2	are always in danger of falling,	Accepting _niccaṁ_ per Norman and Bodhi.
snp3.8:3.3	so mortals once born	NA
snp3.8:3.4	are always in danger of death.	NA
snp3.8:4.1	As clay pots	NA
snp3.8:4.2	made by a potter	NA
snp3.8:4.3	all end up being broken,	NA
snp3.8:4.4	so is the life of mortals.	NA
snp3.8:5.1	Young and old,	NA
snp3.8:5.2	foolish and wise—	NA
snp3.8:5.3	all go under the sway of death;	NA
snp3.8:5.4	all are destined to die.	NA
snp3.8:6.1	When those overcome by death	NA
snp3.8:6.2	leave this world for the next,	NA
snp3.8:6.3	a father cannot protect his son,	NA
snp3.8:6.4	nor relatives their kin.	NA
snp3.8:7.1	See how, while relatives look on,	NA
snp3.8:7.2	wailing profusely,	NA
snp3.8:7.3	mortals are led away one by one,	NA
snp3.8:7.4	like a cow to the slaughter.	NA
snp3.8:8.1	And so the world is stricken	NA
snp3.8:8.2	by old age and by death.	NA
snp3.8:8.3	That is why the attentive do not grieve,	NA
snp3.8:8.4	for they understand the way of the world.	NA
snp3.8:9.1	For one whose path you do not know—	NA
snp3.8:9.2	not whence they came nor where they went—	NA
snp3.8:9.3	you lament in vain,	NA
snp3.8:9.4	seeing neither end.	NA
snp3.8:10.1	If a bewildered person,	NA
snp3.8:10.2	lamenting and self-harming,	NA
snp3.8:10.3	could extract any good from that,	NA
snp3.8:10.4	then those who see clearly would do the same.	NA
snp3.8:11.1	For not by weeping and wailing	NA
snp3.8:11.2	will you find peace of heart.	NA
snp3.8:11.3	It just gives rise to more suffering,	NA
snp3.8:11.4	and distresses your body.	NA
snp3.8:12.1	Growing thin and pale,	NA
snp3.8:12.2	you hurt yourself.	NA
snp3.8:12.3	It does nothing to help the dead:	NA
snp3.8:12.4	your lamentation is in vain.	NA
snp3.8:13.1	Unless a person gives up grief,	NA
snp3.8:13.2	they fall into suffering all the more.	NA
snp3.8:13.3	Bewailing those whose time has come,	NA
snp3.8:13.4	you fall under the sway of grief.	NA
snp3.8:14.1	See, too, other folk departing	NA
snp3.8:14.2	to fare after their deeds;	NA
snp3.8:14.3	fallen under the sway of death,	NA

snp3.8:15.1	For whatever you imagine it is,	NA

snp3.8:16.1	Even if a human lives	NA
snp3.8:16.2	a hundred years or more,	NA
snp3.8:16.3	they are parted from their family circle,	NA

snp3.8:17.1	Therefore, having learned from the Perfected One,	NA
snp3.8:17.2	dispel lamentation.	NA
snp3.8:17.3	Seeing the dead and departed, think:	NA
snp3.8:17.4	“I cannot escape this.”	The commentary says this means, “I cannot bring back the dead”, which is followed by Norman and Bodhi. But I think the text elides a second negative and should read: _na eso alabbhā_, literally “This is not not-to-be-gotten by me”, i.e. “I cannot escape this”.
snp3.8:18.1	As one would extinguish	NA
snp3.8:18.2	a blazing refuge with water,	NA
snp3.8:18.3	so too an attentive one—a wise,	NA

snp3.8:20.1	With dart plucked out, unattached,	NA

snp3.9:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 3.9	NA
snp3.9:0.2	With Vāseṭṭha	NA
snp3.9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	NA
snp3.9:1.3	Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included	NA
snp3.9:1.4	the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.	NA
snp3.9:1.5	Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question:	NA
snp3.9:1.6	“How do you become a brahmin?”	NA
snp3.9:2.1	Bhāradvāja said this:	NA
snp3.9:2.2	“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation—	NA
snp3.9:2.3	then you’re a brahmin.”	NA
snp3.9:3.1	Vāseṭṭha said this:	NA
snp3.9:3.2	“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—	_Vattasampanno_ (Sanskrit _vṛttasaṁpanna_) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone who is “of good conduct, knows the law, and speaks the truth” (_vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini_. See also eg. Mahābhārata 3.188.90b, 13.61.029a, Rāmāyaṇa 1.47.25c).
snp3.9:3.3	then you’re a brahmin.”	NA
snp3.9:3.4	But neither was able to persuade the other.	NA
snp3.9:4.1	So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,	NA
snp3.9:4.2	“Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.	NA
snp3.9:4.3	He has this good reputation:	NA
snp3.9:4.4	‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’	NA
snp3.9:4.5	Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.	NA
snp3.9:4.6	As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”	NA
snp3.9:4.7	“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.	NA
snp3.9:5.1	So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
snp3.9:5.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,	NA
snp3.9:5.3	and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:	NA
snp3.9:6.1	“We’re both authorized masters	NA
snp3.9:6.2	of the three Vedas.	NA
snp3.9:6.3	I’m a student of Pokkharasāti,	NA
snp3.9:6.4	and he of Tārukkha.	NA
snp3.9:7.1	We’re fully qualified	NA
snp3.9:7.2	in all the Vedic experts teach.	NA
snp3.9:7.3	As philologists and grammarians,	NA
snp3.9:7.4	we match our tutors in recitation.	NA
snp3.9:8.1	We have a dispute	NA
snp3.9:8.2	regarding genealogy.	NA
snp3.9:8.3	For Bhāradvāja says that	NA
snp3.9:8.4	one is a brahmin due to birth,	NA
snp3.9:8.5	but I declare it’s because of one’s deeds.	NA
snp3.9:8.6	Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate.	NA
snp3.9:9.1	Since neither of us was able	NA
snp3.9:9.2	to convince the other,	NA
snp3.9:9.3	we’ve come to ask you, sir,	NA
snp3.9:9.4	renowned as the awakened one.	NA
snp3.9:10.1	As people honor with joined palms	NA
snp3.9:10.2	the moon on the cusp of waxing,	NA
snp3.9:10.3	bowing, they revere	NA
snp3.9:10.4	Gotama in the world.	NA
snp3.9:11.1	We ask this of Gotama,	The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).  See [dn16:5.6.3]().
snp3.9:11.2	the Eye arisen in the world:	NA
snp3.9:11.3	is one a brahmin due to birth,	NA
snp3.9:11.4	or else because of deeds?	NA
snp3.9:11.5	We don’t know, please tell us,	NA

snp3.10:0.1	Anthology of Discourses 3.10	NA
snp3.10:0.2	With Kokālika	NA
snp3.10:1.1	So I have heard.	This discourse occurs in shorter, and presumably earlier, versions in the Sagāthāvagga ([sn6.10]()) and the Aṅguttara ([an10.89]()). A Chinese parallel is included in DA 30.
snp3.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
snp3.10:1.3	Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
snp3.10:1.4	“Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.”	NA
snp3.10:2.1	When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika,	NA
snp3.10:2.2	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!	NA
snp3.10:2.3	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,	NA
snp3.10:2.4	they’re good monks.”	NA
snp3.10:3.1	For a second time …	NA
snp3.10:3.2	For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha,	NA
snp3.10:3.3	“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.”	NA
snp3.10:3.4	For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,	NA
snp3.10:3.5	“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!	NA
snp3.10:3.6	Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna,	NA
snp3.10:3.7	they’re good monks.”	NA
snp3.10:4.1	Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
snp3.10:4.2	Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.	NA
snp3.10:4.3	The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood-apples, then ripe wood-apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.	NA
snp3.10:4.4	Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.	NA
snp3.10:4.5	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.	This discourse gives no fewer than three independent ways of counting the duration of the Pink Lotus (_paduma_) hell, plus a simile, plus a commentary. The key to reconciling the three numbers is to consider them numerologically rather than mathematically: simple numbers convey the basic meaning, which is expanded by multiplication. All three methods yield 512 to various powers of ten. 512 breaks down to 500 (= a large number) plus 12 (= months of the year), with the sense, “a long period of time”. In one case, 12 expands to 36 (= months of the year in past, present, and future); numerologically, such variations are different expressions of the same idea. The exact quantity of the power of ten varies, but each is a multiple of the other by 10 million (a crore or _koṭi_ or _abbuda_). The result conveys the sense, “a super-expanded long period of time”.
snp3.10:5.1	Then, late at night, the glorious divinity Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
snp3.10:5.2	“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.	NA
snp3.10:5.3	He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”	NA
snp3.10:5.4	That’s what the divinity Sahampati said.	NA
snp3.10:5.5	Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.	NA
snp3.10:6.1	Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.	NA
snp3.10:7.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	NA
snp3.10:7.2	“Sir, how long is the lifespan in the Pink Lotus hell?”	NA
snp3.10:7.3	“It’s long, mendicant.	NA
snp3.10:7.4	It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”	NA
snp3.10:7.5	“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”	NA
snp3.10:7.6	“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.	NA
snp3.10:8.1	“Suppose there was a Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.	A sesame seed weighs about 0.002 grams (“Some Physical Properties of Sesame Seed”, T.Y. Tunde-Akintunde and B.O. Akintund). The “pack” (_khāri_, originally “donkey-load”) of the Arthaśāstra is about 150 kg (Olivelle *King, Governance, and Law*, appendix 2, pg. 458). Twenty packs would be 3 tons, which is reasonable for a “load” (_vāha_) drawn by a heavy bullock cart (Arthaśāsatra 2.19.33 reckons the _vaha_ similarly at about 2 tons). This results in 1.5 billion seeds and 150 billion years. On the other hand, the Pali _khāri_ is carried by a single person and must be closer to 20 kg ([sn3.11:2.1](), [sn7.9:14.1](), [dn3:2.4.7](), [ud6.2:2.1]()). That would make a “Kosalan load” of 400 kg, which is reasonable for a load drawn by a single horse. This results in 250 million seeds and 25 billion years. This number is interesting because it is similar to the modern cosmological estimate of the life of the Universe. Neither of these results, however, agrees very well with the other calculations in this Sutta. The correspondence is not in the result but the simple numbers: twenty packs each hundred years correspond to the twenty times ten of the hells.
snp3.10:8.2	By this means the Kosalan load of twenty packs of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.	Different texts reckon the _abbuda_ (Sanskrit _arbuda_) to different powers of ten. Most authorities, however, count it at 10 million, which must be the correct value here, as it ultimately yields the number 512 for the _paduma_. | Ten hells are listed in total, the names of which do not correspond with the 21 or 28 listed in Purāṇas, nor with the seven Jain hells, nor with the hells of [mn130](). The commentary offers three explanations for the obscure names of these hells: they are numbers reflecting the duration spent in Avīci; or they are the cries uttered by those suffering there; or they are simply the cold hells.
snp3.10:8.3	Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.	The Sanskrit _nyarbuda_ (or _nirbuda_) is said, rather, to be ten times the _arbuda_. The expansion in a series of twenty is required to reach the final number of 512.
snp3.10:8.4	Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.	These names appear to be nonsensical. the commentary says they are named for the laments of their victims. The parallel at DA 30:104 offers specific explanations for each, although the names sometimes differ from the Pali.
snp3.10:8.5	Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.	NA
snp3.10:8.6	Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.	NA
snp3.10:8.7	Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.	NA
snp3.10:8.8	Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Fragrant Water Lily hell.	The _sogandhika_ is variously identified as blue or white.
snp3.10:8.9	Twenty lifetimes in the Fragrant Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.	NA
snp3.10:8.10	Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.	NA
snp3.10:8.11	Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.	By this calculation, the Pink Lotus lasts for 10⁷ ×  20⁹ = 5.12 × 10¹⁸ years. The commentary supplies its own method, based on a very large _abbuda_ of 10⁴². Nonetheless, this still yields a number in the same series, simply raised to a higher power of ten, namely 5.12 × 10⁵³.
snp3.10:8.12	The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”	NA
snp3.10:8.13	That is what the Buddha said.	NA
snp3.10:8.14	Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:	NA
snp3.10:9.1	“A person is born	NA

snp3.10:12.1	For a hundred thousand times a hundred million,	The commentary, followed by Bodhi and Norman, conjoins this line with the “thirty-six” of the next. But the expression is found in three other passages of the Sagāthāvagga, and in all three it stands as a separate line ([sn6.4:5.3](), [sn1.32:14.3](), [sn5.5:4.1]()). | Here, we take an _abbuda_ as 10 million and a _nirabbuda_ as a hundred million.
snp3.10:12.2	times five hundred and thirty-six times <j>a thousand times ten million years	Vanarata suggests that the “thousands” of the first line should be distributed to the second line as well (Bodhi, *Numerical Discourses*, note 626, p. 1678). This kind of distribution of terms is common in mathematics; for an example in Pali verse, see [sn6.6:5.1](). Here, however, it provides a crucial key to interpretation and translation. But we need to go further: the singular “hundred” in the first line is distributed to the singulars 36 and 5 in the second, while the plural “thousands” is distributed to the plural _abbudāni_ (“tens of millions”). Thus we read the distributed line here as _chattiṁsati pañcasataṁ ca_ (five hundred plus thirty-six)  _sahassānaṁ abbudāni_ (“of thousands, tens of millions”). The juxtaposed numbers are multiplied. The duration of the Pink Lotus then works out as (100,000 × 100,000,000) × (536 × 1000 × 10,000,000) = 5.36 × 10²⁵ years.

snp3.11:28.4	they’d cross over this abyss.

Notably, _naraka_ is not strongly attested in the sense of “hell” for pre-Buddhist Sanskrit either, although we do find _nāraka_, apparently in the sense of “hell being”, at Atharva Veda 12.4.36c and Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5.

The only usage of _uccāvaca_ in the context of practice is the “diverse duties” performed by mendicants for their fellows (eg. [dn33:3.3.17]()).
snp3.11:36.2	as explained by the Ascetic.	Norman’s proposal that this is not the Buddha is implausible.

snp3.11:36.4	nor having gone once do they fall away.	Both Bodhi and Norman discuss this line, without any compelling conclusion. The problematic _mutaṁ_ cannot mean “experienced” per Bodhi and Norman following the commentary. Since the Kathāvatthu is by far the earliest source on this verse, I suggest we adopt its reading that the verse is about “falling away”, and amend _mutaṁ_ to _cutaṁ_.

The PTS edition, as does the BJT, has a reciter’s remark here identifying the speaker as the Buddha, and this is translated without comment by Norman and Bodhi.

snp3.12:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
snp3.12:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
snp3.12:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
snp3.12:1.4	Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them:	NA
snp3.12:2.1	“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer:	NA
snp3.12:2.2	‘Only so as to truly know the pairs of teachings.’	NA
snp3.12:2.3	And what pairs do they speak of?	NA
snp3.12:3.1	‘This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering’: this is the first contemplation.	NA
snp3.12:3.2	‘This is the cessation of suffering; this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.	NA
snp3.12:3.3	When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results:	NA

snp3.12:4.1	That is what the Buddha said.	NA

But this is a stock line, and it’s hard to read _anveti_ as anything other than “follows”. Niddesa ([mnd1:70.2]()) has _anveti anugacchati anvāyikaṁ hoti_. The metaphor is not that water “enters” a boat, but that a leaky boat already contains water and takes it along (like a shadow or an ox-cart per the opening verses of the Dhammapada).

However the phrase occurs in a very similar context at [sn3.10:5.2]() and [dhp346:2](), where it refers to the chains that are hard to escape.

snp4.3:0.2	Eight on Malice	NA
snp4.3:1.1	Some speak with malicious intent,	_Duṭṭhamana_, or more commonly _paduṭṭhamana_, means “malice” not “corruption”, as is found through the suttas and confirmed by the Niddesa.

snp4.3:2.1	How can you transcend your own view	NA
snp4.3:2.2	when you’re led by preference, dogmatic in belief?	Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render _chanda_ as “desire”, and that is certainly the sense of _chandānunīto_ at [sn35.94:6.4](). Here, however, Niddesa glosses with synonyms for “view” and this seems like a more plausible sense. Note too the sense of _niviṭṭha_ as “dogmatic”, which recurs through the Aṭṭhakavagga (cp. _abhinivesa_).
snp4.3:2.3	Inventing your own undertakings,	_Samattāni_ is regularly used of vows “undertaken”, and given the following verse this is surely the meaning here, *contra* Niddesa and commentary. See [snp4.4:5.1](), where _samādāya_ is used in the same sense.
snp4.3:2.4	you’d speak according to your notion.	Here we find a sense of _jānāti_ that doesn’t fit the English idea of “knowledge” as “true belief”. The idea is that they speak from their own (limited and opinionated) ideas. It’s not as pejorative as “opinion” nor as solid as “knowledge”, so I render as “notion”. We find this usage commonly in the final two chapters of Snp.
snp4.3:3.1	Some, unasked, tell others	NA

snp4.3:4.3	They have a noble nature, say those who are skilled,	NA
snp4.3:4.4	who have no pretensions about anything in the world.	_Ussada_, here rendered “pretension”, is a poetic term with the literal sense of “swelling”. In this chapter it has a close connection with “pride” ([snp4.10:8.4](), [snp4.14:6.4](); cf. the English sense of pride as “protuberance”), although this connection is less obvious elsewhere ([snp3.6:14.4](), [iti97:8.4](), and [ud1.4:2.1]() = [pli-tv-kd1:2.3.6]()). Its absence is a sign of a true brahmin ([mn98:11.19](), [dhp400:2](), [snp3.9:36.1]()). The Niddesa does not link it with pride especially, rather explaining it as sevenfold: greed, hate, delusion, conceit, views, corruptions, and deeds ([mnd10:105.4]()).

snp4.4:1.1	“I see someone pure, perfectly healthy;	The sight of saint or holy person was believed to grant blessings (see [an6.30](), [mn81:6.5](), [snp2.4:10.2]()). As Bodhi remarks, _aroga_ (“healthy”) refers to the “self”, which is frequently described as the subtle body that survives death ([dn1:2.38.3](): _rūpī attā hoti arogo_). Here, however, what is “seen” is the soul as a physical body manifesting purity and wellness, as in the case of Māgaṇḍiya ([mn75:19.15]()).
snp4.4:1.2	it is vision that grants a person purity.”	NA
snp4.4:1.3	Recalling this notion of the ultimate,	Here as in [snp4.3](), _ñāṇa_ is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking _abhijāna_ in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their vision of a holy man believes that there must be an observer of such purity, i.e. a self.
snp4.4:1.4	they believe in the notion <j>that there is one who observes purity.	_Pacceti_ is a standard verb for someone who “believes” in a religious rite or idea.

snp4.4:2.2	or if by a notion they could give up suffering,	NA

snp4.4:4.1	Having let go the last they lay hold of the next;	NA
snp4.4:4.2	following impulse, they don’t get past the snare.	Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render _saṅga_ in some variant of “tie, attachment”. Yet that fails to render the metaphor. _Saṅga_ is used in the sense of a “snare” in which one may be caught, like a net ([snp3.6:28.4]()). And a snare is indeed something that one may cross over or get past.
snp4.4:4.3	They grab on and let go like a monkey	NA
snp4.4:4.4	grabbing and releasing a branch.	The monkey grabs the branches, not the trunk, as a metaphor for missing the essence. And to drive home the pun, religious orders are called “branches”.

snp4.4:5.2	visits various teachers, <j>being attached to perception.	See _uccāvacaṁ vā pana dassanāya gacchati_ at [an6.30:2.2](). In the current poem, it refers to someone who visits a variety of teachers or sects, as per Niddesa.

snp4.9:4.2	said Māgaṇḍiya,	Two Māgaṇḍiyas appear in the Pali canon: here and in [mn75]() where he attacks the Buddha as a destroyer of life. As to the protagonist of the current sutta, the Pali commentary, Divyāvadāna 36—which calls him Mākandika—and the Chinese parallel in the Arthapada (T iv 180) say he too hails from the Kuru country, as also at [mn75](). Now, the Mahābhārata and other Sanskrit sources name Mākandī as a city or province on the banks of the Ganges, in the Pañcāla kingdom south of Hastināpura. This more-or-less agrees with Māgaṇḍiya’s home in the Kuru country, and suggests his name means “the man from Mākandī”. Divyāvadāna 36 and Sanskrit fragment say the Mākandika of the current sutta was also a wanderer, which does not contradict the position of the Pali commentaries and the Arthapada that he was a brahmin. At [an5.294-302:1.1]() _māgaṇḍika_ is listed as a type of ascetic; these could well be students of Māgaṇḍiya. Kathāsaritsāgara 15 tells the comic farce of an ascetic from Mākandikā on the banks of the Ganges, who fell in love with the daughter of a merchant and went to ridiculous lengths to obtain her, only to end up a laughing-stock. This story could well have begun life as a comic inversion of this sutta. Reading all these sources together, we can posit that there was a brahmin wanderer from Mākandī on the Ganges in Kuru, who gained a certain fame and following as a teacher, but who is mainly remembered for his failed schemes. The Pali commentaries further specify that the Māgaṇḍiya of [mn75]() is the nephew of the one in the current sutta.

snp4.12:5.1	I do not say that it is correct	I think “this is correct” refers, not to the assertion of a view, but to the assertion that the other is a fool. Niddesa takes it to mean the assertion of one of the 62 views, but this seems to be reading into the text.
snp4.12:5.2	when they call each other fools.	Here I take _bālā_ as the quoted speech, as in the lines above and below. The commentary supplies the expected quotation indicator: _‘bālo’ti āhu_. If we take _bālā_ as subject of the verb here, per Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, then the Buddha is adopting the reductive language of those he seeks to counter, obscuring the sense of the verse.
snp4.12:5.3	Each has built up their own view to be the truth,	It’s important to maintain the past sense of _akaṁsu_ here: a view is something they have constructed and built up over time; it has solidified and become part of them, which is why it’s so hard to give up.

The Niddesa glosses _aññatra saññāya niccaggāhā_, which is translated by Bodhi as “apart from the grasping of permanence by perception”. But this seems impossible to me: _saññāya_ is an ablative constructed with _aññatra_, and _niccāni_ surely agrees with _saccāni_. Further, the sense of this reading is a stretch, as we haven’t dealt with impermanence at all so far. I think the allusion is, rather, to the idea of _dhammaniyāmatā_, the “ﬁxity” or “regularity” of the Dhamma as an “eternal truth”.

snp4.13:12.2	just as they praise their own journeys,	NA
snp4.13:12.3	then all doctrines would be equally valid,	NA
snp4.13:12.4	and purity for them would be an individual matter.	Cp. [dhp165:5](), where an apparently similar idea (_suddhī asuddhi paccattaṁ_) is Buddhist. There, the emphasis is on the personal realization of the teachings, here on different, contradictory, realizations.

snp5.1:1.4	aspiring to nothingness.	NA
snp5.1:2.1	He settled in a region under the shared dominion	NA
snp5.1:2.2	of Assaka and Muḷaka,	The inscription Siri Pulumayi at Nasik supports the spelling _muḷaka_. (Sylvain Lévi, “Gonarda, The Cradle of the Gonardiya”, Journal Of The Andhra Historical Society, vol.9, pt.1, July 1934, pg. 8.)
snp5.1:2.3	where he lived on the bank of the Godāvarī River,	This is the only early occurrence of this famed sacred river of the south. It arises near Nashik, Maharashtra, not far from Mumbai on the west coast, and flows east for 1,465 kilometres before emptying in the Bay of Bengal. The name _godāvarī_ means “granter of cows” due to the abundance the river brings to the lands through which it flows. The town at its source was called Govardhana, “cow-prosperity”. Normally spelled _godhāvarī_ in Pali, the form _godāvarī_ is standard in Sanskrit, including Buddhist texts (eg. Mahāvastu 3.363) and it seems the Pali spelling is an error.

snp5.1:3.1	He was supported	NA
snp5.1:3.2	by a prosperous village nearby.	NA
snp5.1:3.3	With the revenue earned from there	NA
snp5.1:3.4	he performed a great sacrifice.	NA
snp5.1:4.1	When he had completed the great sacrifice,	NA
snp5.1:4.2	he returned to his hermitage once more.	NA
snp5.1:4.3	Upon his return,	NA
snp5.1:4.4	another brahmin arrived.	NA
snp5.1:5.1	Foot-sore and thirsty,	NA
snp5.1:5.2	with grotty teeth and dusty head,	NA
snp5.1:5.3	he approached the other	NA
snp5.1:5.4	and asked for five hundred coins.	NA
snp5.1:6.1	When Bāvari saw him,	NA
snp5.1:6.2	he invited him to sit down,	NA
snp5.1:6.3	asked of his happiness and well-being,	NA
snp5.1:6.4	and said the following.	NA
snp5.1:7.1	“Whatever I had available to give,	NA
snp5.1:7.2	I have already distributed.	NA
snp5.1:7.3	Believe me, brahmin,	NA

snp5.1:8.2	give me what I ask,	NA
snp5.1:8.3	then on the seventh day,	NA
snp5.1:8.4	let your head explode in seven!”	The threat of losing one’s head is found at eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.8.6 and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.24, or at 3.9.26 when it actually did fall off. I cannot trace the detail of heads being split in seven to any early Sanskrit texts, but it is found in later texts such as Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.44c and Mahābhārata 14.7.2c.
snp5.1:9.1	After performing a ritual,	NA
snp5.1:9.2	that charlatan uttered his dreadful curse.	NA

snp5.1:10.1	Not eating, he grew emaciated,	NA
snp5.1:10.2	stricken by the dart of sorrow.	NA
snp5.1:10.3	And in such a state of mind,	NA
snp5.1:10.4	he could not enjoy absorption.	NA
snp5.1:11.1	Seeing him anxious and distraught,	NA
snp5.1:11.2	a goddess wishing to help,	NA
snp5.1:11.3	approached Bāvari	NA
snp5.1:11.4	and said the following.	NA
snp5.1:12.1	“That charlatan understands nothing	NA
snp5.1:12.2	about the head, he only wants money.	NA
snp5.1:12.3	When it comes to heads or head-splitting,	NA

snp5.1:15.2	who exactly does know	Note that, in the EBTs, _pathavimaṇḍala_ primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”.

snp5.1:19.1	When he heard the word “Buddha”,	NA
snp5.1:19.2	Bāvari was elated.	NA
snp5.1:19.3	His sorrow faded,	NA
snp5.1:19.4	and he was filled to brimming with joy.	NA
snp5.1:20.1	Uplifted, elated, and inspired,	NA

snp5.1:20.5	where we may go and pay respects	NA
snp5.1:20.6	to the Awakened One, best of men?”	NA
snp5.1:21.1	“Near Sāvatthī, home of the Kosalans, <j>is the Victor	_Mandira_ is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home.
snp5.1:21.2	abounding in wisdom, vast in intelligence.	NA
snp5.1:21.3	That Sakyan is indefatigable, free of defilements,	The commentary gives the senses _vigatadhuro_ “free of burden” (followed by Norman) and _appaṭimo_ “unrivalled” (followed by Bodhi), but at [an3.20:2.1]() it has the sense “indefatigable” and there seems no reason why it shouldn’t have the same meaning here.

snp5.1:22.1	Therefore he addressed his acolytes,	NA

One of the many signs of lateness in this passage. _Vāsana_ in this sense is found only in the very latest strata of canonical and semi-canonical texts such as the Milindapañha, where we find _pubbe vāsitavāsanā_ ([mil6.2.1:3.2]()).
snp5.1:35.1	Having bowed to Bāvari,	NA
snp5.1:35.2	and circled him to his right,	NA
snp5.1:35.3	they set out for the north,	NA
snp5.1:35.4	with their dreadlocks and hides.	NA
snp5.1:36.1	First to Patiṭṭhāna of Muḷaka,	Modern Paithan.
snp5.1:36.2	then on to the citadel of Māhissatī;	The Sinhalese commentary explains _puri_ or _pura_ as “former”, while the Burmese commentary explains it as “citadel”. The city continued under this name for many centuries, so “former” seems unlikely. It is modern Maheshwar.

snp5.1:37.2	and the supreme city of Sāvatthī;	NA

snp5.1:37.4	and the homestead at Kusinārā.	See my remarks on _mandira_ above. Kusinārā was famously *not* a city.

thag1.1:4.1	My hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind:	NA
thag1.1:4.2	so rain, heavens, as you please!	The word _deva_ (“god”) is closely connected with the idea of the sky. The “god” of thunder and rain (perhaps to be identified with the god named Pajjuna) is a terrifying threat to those who are exposed outdoors. Here the monk snug in his little hut invokes the god in contrast to the safety of peace. This idea recurs many times in the Theragāthā. At [snp1.2]() the same notion occurs in the context of making household offerings to the gods.
thag1.1:4.3	My mind is serene and freed,	NA

thag1.40:0.4	Vaḍḍhamāna	NA
thag1.40:1.1	Like they’re struck by a sword,	This Vaḍḍhamāna is unknown elsewhere. According to the commentary, as a layman, he committed such an offence that the Buddha resorted to the rather extreme means of overturning the bowl against him, “like stepping on a fire”. He repented, asked forgiveness, and later ordained. But he was lazy so the Buddha urged him with this verse. The commentary says he was born in royal Licchavī family of Vesālī. The Jain founder Mahāvīra Vardhamāna was said to have been born near Vesālī, and his mother was a Licchavī. Perhaps this verse was intended to belittle the Jain founder, but the commentary does not link the two.

thag6.5:1.1	When a man lives heedlessly,	NA
thag6.5:1.2	craving grows in them like a camel’s foot creeper.	NA
thag6.5:1.3	They jump from life to life, like a langur	NA
thag6.5:1.4	greedy for fruit in a forest grove.	The _vānara_ is a type of human-like monkey often identified with the langur. See [ja57]().
thag6.5:2.1	Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving,	NA
thag6.5:2.2	this attachment to the world,	NA
thag6.5:2.3	their sorrow grows,	NA
thag6.5:2.4	like grass in the rain.	NA
thag6.5:3.1	But whoever prevails over this wretched craving,	NA
thag6.5:3.2	so hard to get over in the world,	NA
thag6.5:3.3	their sorrows fall from them,	NA
thag6.5:3.4	like a drop from a lotus-leaf.	NA
thag6.5:4.1	I say this to you, good people,	NA
thag6.5:4.2	all those who have gathered here:	NA
thag6.5:4.3	dig up the root of craving,	NA
thag6.5:4.4	as you’d dig up the grass in search of roots.	NA
thag6.5:4.5	Don’t let Māra break you again and again,	NA
thag6.5:4.6	like a stream breaking a reed.	NA
thag6.5:5.1	Act on the Buddha’s words,	NA
thag6.5:5.2	don’t let the moment pass you by.	NA
thag6.5:5.3	For if you miss your moment	NA
thag6.5:5.4	you’ll grieve when sent to hell.	NA
thag6.5:6.1	Negligence is always dust;	NA
thag6.5:6.2	dust follows right behind negligence.	NA

thag6.6:1.1	In the twenty-five years	NA
thag6.6:1.2	since I went forth,	NA
thag6.6:1.3	I have not found peace of mind,	NA
thag6.6:1.4	even as long as a finger-snap.	NA
thag6.6:2.1	Since I couldn’t get my mind unified,	NA
thag6.6:2.2	I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses.	NA
thag6.6:2.3	Wailing, with outstretched arms,	NA
thag6.6:2.4	I left my dwelling.	NA
thag6.6:3.1	Shall I … or shall I commit suicide?	NA
thag6.6:3.2	What’s the point of living?	NA
thag6.6:3.3	For how on earth can one such as me die	NA
thag6.6:3.4	after resigning the training?	NA
thag6.6:4.1	Then I picked up a razor,	NA
thag6.6:4.2	I sat on a cot:	NA
thag6.6:4.3	the razor was ready	NA
thag6.6:4.4	to slice my vein.	NA
thag6.6:5.1	Then the realization	NA
thag6.6:5.2	came upon me—	NA
thag6.6:5.3	the danger became clear,	NA
thag6.6:5.4	and I was firmly disillusioned.	NA
thag6.6:6.1	Then my mind was freed—	NA
thag6.6:6.2	see the excellence of the teaching!	NA

thag6.7:5.1	Meditate and conquer, Kātiyāna,	NA
thag6.7:5.2	you’re an expert in the path <j>to sanctuary  from the yoke.	NA
thag6.7:5.3	Attaining unexcelled purity,	NA
thag6.7:5.4	you’ll be extinguished as a flame by water.	NA
thag6.7:6.1	A lamp of feeble flame	NA
thag6.7:6.2	is bent down by the wind, like a creeper;	NA
thag6.7:6.3	just so, kinsman of Indra,	NA

thag6.8:1.1	It was well-taught by the Clear-eyed One,	NA
thag6.8:1.2	the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun,	NA
thag6.8:1.3	who has transcended all fetters,	NA

thag6.8:2.1	Emancipating, it leads across,	NA
thag6.8:2.2	drying up the root of craving,	NA
thag6.8:2.3	and, having cut off the poisonous root, <j>the slaughterhouse,	NA
thag6.8:2.4	it leads to quenching.	NA
thag6.8:3.1	By breaking the root of unknowing,	NA
thag6.8:3.2	it smashes the mechanism of deeds,	NA
thag6.8:3.3	and drops the thunderbolt of knowledge	NA
thag6.8:3.4	on the taking up of consciousnesses.	NA
thag6.8:4.1	It informs us of our feelings,	NA
thag6.8:4.2	releasing us from grasping,	NA
thag6.8:4.3	contemplating with understanding	NA
thag6.8:4.4	all states of existence as a pit of burning coals.	NA
thag6.8:5.1	It’s very sweet and very deep,	NA
thag6.8:5.2	holding birth and death at bay;	NA
thag6.8:5.3	it is the noble eightfold path—	NA
thag6.8:5.4	the stilling of suffering, bliss.	NA
thag6.8:6.1	Knowing deed as deed	NA
thag6.8:6.2	and result as result;	NA
thag6.8:6.3	seeing dependently originated phenomena	NA

thag6.9:3.1	I never paid homage to anyone:	NA
thag6.9:3.2	not even my mother or father,	NA

thag6.9:4.3	shining like the sun,	NA
thag6.9:4.4	at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha,	NA
thag6.9:5.1	I discarded conceit and vanity,	NA
thag6.9:5.2	and, with a clear and confident heart,	NA
thag6.9:5.3	I bowed down with my head	NA
thag6.9:5.4	to the most excellent of all beings.	NA
thag6.9:6.1	The conceit of superiority <j>and the conceit of inferiority	NA

thag7.3:6.4	That was my ordination.	NA

thag7.4:1.1	I saw the supreme person	NA

thag7.4:1.3	so I approached,	NA
thag7.4:1.4	and bowed to the supreme among men.	NA
thag7.4:2.1	Arranging my robe over one shoulder	NA
thag7.4:2.2	and clasping my hands together,	NA
thag7.4:2.3	I walked alongside that stainless one,	NA
thag7.4:2.4	supreme among all beings.	NA
thag7.4:3.1	The wise one, expert in questions,	NA
thag7.4:3.2	questioned me.	NA
thag7.4:3.3	Brave and fearless,	NA
thag7.4:3.4	I answered the teacher.	NA
thag7.4:4.1	When all his questions were answered,	NA
thag7.4:4.2	the Realized One congratulated me.	NA
thag7.4:4.3	Looking around the mendicant Saṅgha,	NA
thag7.4:4.4	he said the following:	NA
thag7.4:5.1	“It is a blessing for the people of Aṅga and Magadha	NA
thag7.4:5.2	that this person enjoys their	NA

thag7.4:5.5	their respect and service—	NA
thag7.4:5.6	it’s a blessing for them,” he declared.	NA
thag7.4:6.1	“Sopāka, from this day on	NA

thag7.5:0.4	Sarabhaṅga	NA
thag7.5:1.1	I broke the reeds off with my hands,	NA
thag7.5:1.2	made a hut, and stayed there.	NA
thag7.5:1.3	That’s how I became known	NA
thag7.5:1.4	as “Reed-breaker”.	NA
thag7.5:2.1	But now it’s not appropriate	NA
thag7.5:2.2	for me to break reeds with my hands.	NA
thag7.5:2.3	The training rules have been laid down for us	NA
thag7.5:2.4	by Gotama the renowned.	NA
thag7.5:3.1	Previously, I, Sarabhaṅga,	NA
thag7.5:3.2	didn’t see the disease in its entirety.	NA
thag7.5:3.3	But now I have seen the disease,	NA
thag7.5:3.4	as I’ve practiced what was taught <j>by he who is beyond the gods.	NA
thag7.5:4.1	Gotama traveled by that direct route;	NA
thag7.5:4.2	the same path traveled by Vipassī,	NA
thag7.5:4.3	by Sikhī, Vessabhū,	NA
thag7.5:4.4	Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.	NA
thag7.5:5.1	These seven Buddhas have plunged into the ending,	NA
thag7.5:5.2	free of craving, without grasping,	NA
thag7.5:5.3	having become Dhamma, unaffected.	NA
thag7.5:5.4	They have taught this Dhamma	NA
thag7.5:6.1	out of compassion for living creatures—	NA
thag7.5:6.2	suffering, origin, path,	NA
thag7.5:6.3	and cessation, the ending of suffering.	NA
thag7.5:6.4	In these four noble truths,	NA
thag7.5:7.1	the endless suffering of transmigration	NA
thag7.5:7.2	finally comes to an end.	NA
thag7.5:7.3	When the body breaks up,	NA

thag8.1:2.1	They know it really is a bog,	NA
thag8.1:2.2	this homage and veneration in respectable families.	NA
thag8.1:2.3	Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract,	NA

thag8.1:3.3	You yourself should not do bad,	NA

thag8.1:4.1	You’re not a bandit because of what someone says,	NA

thag8.1:5.1	When others do not understand,	NA
thag8.1:5.2	let us, who do understand this,	NA

thag8.1:5.4	for that is how conflicts are laid to rest.	NA
thag8.1:6.1	A wise person lives on	NA

thag8.1:6.4	even a rich person doesn’t really live.	NA
thag8.1:7.1	All is heard with the ear,	NA

thag8.3:0.4	Mahāpanthaka	NA
thag8.3:1.1	When I first saw the Teacher	NA
thag8.3:1.2	who fears nothing from any quarter,	NA
thag8.3:1.3	I was struck with a sense of urgency,	NA
thag8.3:1.4	seeing the supreme among men.	NA
thag8.3:2.1	Anyone who, having found such a Teacher,	NA
thag8.3:2.2	would lose them again,	NA
thag8.3:2.3	is like one who, when approached by Lady Luck,	NA
thag8.3:2.4	would ward her off with their hands and feet.	“Lady Luck” is Siri, later famed as goddess of fortune and prosperity. The same idiom recurs at [mn49:5.9](). As to why someone would ward her off, Siri (Sanskrit _śrī_) is identified with Lakṣmī “the undeparting” (Śrī Sūkta 2, _lakṣmīmanapagāminīm_). Atharva Veda 7.115 opens with, “Fly away wicked Lakṣmī, vanish, fly hence”. Apparently 101 Lakṣmīs attach to a man when born, and the spell chases away the wicked (_pāpi_) while keeping the good (_puṇya_). In this case the Pali text does not draw directly from the Veda, as there is no close verbal parallel, and the Pali presents as irrational an action that makes good sense in the context of the Vedic passage. Rather, it would seem, the Pali draws from a more general cultural awareness.
thag8.3:3.1	Then I left behind my children and wives,	NA
thag8.3:3.2	my riches and my grain;	NA
thag8.3:3.3	I had my hair and beard cut off,	NA
thag8.3:3.4	and went forth to homelessness.	NA
thag8.3:4.1	Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood,	NA
thag8.3:4.2	my sense faculties well-restrained,	NA
thag8.3:4.3	paying homage to the Buddha,	NA
thag8.3:4.4	I meditated undefeated.	NA
thag8.3:5.1	Then a wish occurred to me,	NA
thag8.3:5.2	my heart’s truest wish:	NA
thag8.3:5.3	I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a short while,	NA
thag8.3:5.4	until the dart of craving was plucked.	NA
thag8.3:6.1	As I meditate like this,	NA
thag8.3:6.2	see my energy and vigor!	NA
thag8.3:6.3	I’ve attained the three knowledges,	NA
thag8.3:6.4	and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.	NA
thag8.3:7.1	I know my past lives,	NA
thag8.3:7.2	my clairvoyance is clarified;	NA
thag8.3:7.3	I’m perfected, worthy of offerings,	NA
thag8.3:7.4	liberated, free of attachments.	NA
thag8.3:8.1	Then, at the end of the night,	NA
thag8.3:8.2	as the rising of the sun drew near,	NA
thag8.3:8.3	all craving was dried up,	NA
thag8.3:8.4	so I sat down cross-legged.	NA

thag10.4:1.1	My progress was slow,	NA

thag10.4:1.3	Even my brother turned me away,	NA

thag10.4:2.1	Turned away at the gate	NA
thag10.4:2.2	of the Saṅgha’s monastery,	NA
thag10.4:2.3	I stood there sadly,	NA

thag16.1:16.2	so astonishing and hair-raising,	NA
thag16.1:16.3	the young men laid down their swords	NA
thag16.1:16.4	and spoke these words:	NA
thag16.1:17.1	“What have you practiced, Venerable?	NA
thag16.1:17.2	And who is your tutor?	NA
thag16.1:17.3	Whose instructions do we follow	NA
thag16.1:17.4	to gain the sorrowless state?”	NA
thag16.1:18.1	“The knower of all, the seer of all:	NA
thag16.1:18.2	the victor is my tutor.	NA
thag16.1:18.3	He is a Teacher of great compassion,	NA
thag16.1:18.4	healer of the whole world.	NA
thag16.1:19.1	He taught this Dhamma,	NA
thag16.1:19.2	leading to ending, unsurpassed.	NA

thag16.1:19.4	you can gain the sorrowless state.”	NA
thag16.1:20.1	When the bandits heard the good words of the seer,	NA
thag16.1:20.2	they laid down their swords and weapons.	NA
thag16.1:20.3	Some refrained from their former deeds,	NA
thag16.1:20.4	while others chose the going-forth.	NA
thag16.1:21.1	Having gone forth in the teaching of the Holy One,	NA
thag16.1:21.2	those astute ones developed <j>the awakening factors and the powers.	NA
thag16.1:21.3	Elated, happy, their faculties complete,	NA
thag16.1:21.4	they realized the state of extinguishment, the unconditioned.	NA

thag16.2:11.1	This body is full of pus and blood,	NA

thag16.2:12.1	You don’t understand that	NA
thag16.2:12.2	the sweetness of honey turns bitter,	NA

thag16.2:15.3	Though he might enjoy himself,	NA

thag16.2:16.1	One who’s diligent and discerning,	NA

thag16.3:0.1	Verses of the Senior Monks 16.3	NA
thag16.3:0.2	The Book of the Twenties	NA
thag16.3:0.3	Chapter One	NA
thag16.3:0.4	Telakāni	NA
thag16.3:1.1	For a long time, sadly,	NA
thag16.3:1.2	though I keenly contemplated the teaching,	NA
thag16.3:1.3	I gained no peace of mind.	NA
thag16.3:1.4	So I asked this of ascetics and brahmins:	NA
thag16.3:2.1	“Who in the world have crossed over?	NA
thag16.3:2.2	Whose attainment culminates <j>in freedom from death?	NA
thag16.3:2.3	Whose teaching do I accept	NA
thag16.3:2.4	to understand the ultimate goal?	NA
thag16.3:3.1	I was hooked inside,	NA
thag16.3:3.2	like a fish gulping bait;	NA
thag16.3:3.3	bound like the titan Vepaciti	NA
thag16.3:3.4	in Mahinda’s trap.	Mahinda (“Great Indra”) is a name of Sakka, the nemesis of Vepaciti.
thag16.3:4.1	Dragging it along, I’m not free	NA
thag16.3:4.2	from grief and lamentation.	NA
thag16.3:4.3	Who will free me from bonds in the world,	NA
thag16.3:4.4	so that I may know awakening?	NA
thag16.3:5.1	What ascetic or brahmin	NA
thag16.3:5.2	points out what is frail?	NA
thag16.3:5.3	Whose teaching do I accept	NA
thag16.3:5.4	to sweep away old age and death?	NA
thag16.3:6.1	Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,	NA
thag16.3:6.2	secured by the power of aggression,	NA
thag16.3:6.3	stiff as a mind beset by anger;	NA
thag16.3:6.4	the arrow of covetousness,	NA
thag16.3:7.1	propelled by the bow of craving,	NA
thag16.3:7.2	is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribcage—	The commentary explains “twice-fifteen” as the twenty kinds of substantialist view and ten kinds of wrong view. This is implausible, as it clearly has an organic sense. I count it as 24 ribs, plus two bones each for the collar-bones, the shoulder-blades, and the sternum, making thirty in total. The sternum is technically one bone, but it is divided into upper (manubrium) and lower (gladiolus) with a notch between.
thag16.3:7.3	see how it stands in my breast,	NA
thag16.3:7.4	breaking my strong heart.	NA
thag16.3:8.1	Speculative views are not abandoned,	NA
thag16.3:8.2	they are sharpened by memories and intentions;	Read _saṅkappasara_ per PTS for MS’s _saṅkappapara_.
thag16.3:8.3	and pierced by this I tremble,	NA
thag16.3:8.4	like a leaf blowing in the gale.	NA
thag16.3:9.1	Having arisen within,	NA
thag16.3:9.2	what belongs to me burns quickly,	NA
thag16.3:9.3	in that place where the body always heads	NA
thag16.3:9.4	with its six sense-fields of contact.	NA
thag16.3:10.1	I don’t see a healer	NA
thag16.3:10.2	who can pull out my dart of doubt	NA
thag16.3:10.3	without a lance	NA
thag16.3:10.4	or some other blade.	NA
thag16.3:11.1	Without knife or wound,	NA
thag16.3:11.2	who will pull out this dart	NA
thag16.3:11.3	that’s stuck inside me,	NA
thag16.3:11.4	without harming any part of my body?	NA
thag16.3:12.1	He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,	NA
thag16.3:12.2	the best one to cure the damage of poison;	NA
thag16.3:12.3	when I have fallen into deep waters,	NA
thag16.3:12.4	he would show me his hand and the shore.	NA
thag16.3:13.1	I’ve plunged into a lake,	NA
thag16.3:13.2	and I can’t wash off the mud and dirt.	NA
thag16.3:13.3	It’s full of fraud, jealousy, aggression,	NA
thag16.3:13.4	and dullness and drowsiness.	NA
thag16.3:14.1	Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,	NA
thag16.3:14.2	like a rain cloud of fetters;	NA
thag16.3:14.3	lustful thoughts are winds	NA
thag16.3:14.4	that sweep off a person with bad views.	NA
thag16.3:15.1	The streams flow everywhere;	NA
thag16.3:15.2	a weed springs up and remains.	NA
thag16.3:15.3	Who will block the streams?	NA
thag16.3:15.4	Who will cut the weed?”	NA
thag16.3:16.1	“Venerable sir, build a dam	NA
thag16.3:16.2	to block the streams.	NA
thag16.3:16.3	Don’t let your mind-made streams	NA
thag16.3:16.4	cut you down suddenly like a tree.”	NA
thag16.3:17.1	That is how, when I was full of fear,	NA
thag16.3:17.2	seeking the far shore from the near,	NA
thag16.3:17.3	my shelter was the teacher <j>whose weapon is wisdom,	NA
thag16.3:17.4	frequented by the Saṅgha of seers.	NA
thag16.3:18.1	As I was being swept away,	NA
thag16.3:18.2	he gave me a strong, simple ladder,	NA
thag16.3:18.3	made of the heartwood of Dhamma,	NA
thag16.3:18.4	and he said to me: “Do not fear.”	NA
thag16.3:19.1	I climbed the tower of mindfulness meditation,	NA
thag16.3:19.2	and checked back down	NA
thag16.3:19.3	at people delighting in substantial reality,	NA
thag16.3:19.4	as I had obsessed over in the past.	NA
thag16.3:20.1	When I saw the path,	NA
thag16.3:20.2	as I was embarking on the ship,	NA
thag16.3:20.3	without fixating on the self,	NA
thag16.3:20.4	I saw the supreme landing-place.	NA
thag16.3:21.1	The dart that arises in oneself,	NA
thag16.3:21.2	and that which stems from the conduit to rebirth:	NA
thag16.3:21.3	he taught the supreme path	NA
thag16.3:21.4	for the canceling of these.	NA
thag16.3:22.1	For a long time it had lain within me;	NA
thag16.3:22.2	for a long time it was fixed in me:	NA
thag16.3:22.3	the Buddha cast off the knot,	NA
thag16.3:22.4	curing the damage of poison.	NA

thag16.4:4.1	Hair in eight braids	NA

thag16.4:8.1	“I see rich people in the world who,	NA

thag16.4:8.3	Greedily, they hoard their riches,	NA

thag16.4:10.1	Not just the king, but others too,	NA

thag16.4:10.3	They leave the body still wanting,	NA

thag16.4:11.3	They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,	NA
thag16.4:11.4	heap up a pyre, and burn it there.	NA
thag16.4:12.1	It’s poked with stakes while being burnt,	NA
thag16.4:12.2	in just a single cloth, all wealth gone.	NA
thag16.4:12.3	Relatives, friends, and companions	NA
thag16.4:12.4	can’t help you when you’re dying.	NA
thag16.4:13.1	Heirs take your riches,	NA

thag16.4:13.3	Riches don’t follow you when you die;	NA
thag16.4:13.4	nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.	NA
thag16.4:14.1	Longevity isn’t gained by riches,	NA
thag16.4:14.2	nor does wealth banish old age;	NA
thag16.4:14.3	for the attentive say this life is short,	NA
thag16.4:14.4	it’s perishable and not eternal.	NA
thag16.4:15.1	The rich and the poor feel its touch;	NA
thag16.4:15.2	the fool and the attentive one feel it too.	NA

thag16.4:15.4	while the attentive don’t tremble at the touch.	NA
thag16.4:16.1	Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth,	NA
thag16.4:16.2	since by wisdom <j>you reach consummation in this life.	NA

thag16.4:20.1	As fruit falls from a tree, so the sons of Manu fall,	_Māṇava_, which normally means “Vedic student”, is occasionally used in the poetic sense of _manussa_ (“humans”). Both words mean “descendant of the first man, Manu”.
thag16.4:20.2	young and old, when the body breaks up.	NA
thag16.4:20.3	Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;	NA

thag16.6:1.1	“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect,	NA
thag16.6:1.2	you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold;	NA
thag16.6:1.3	golden colored,	NA
thag16.6:1.4	with teeth so white; you’re strong.	NA
thag16.6:2.1	The characteristics	NA
thag16.6:2.2	of a handsome man,	NA
thag16.6:2.3	the marks of a great man,	NA
thag16.6:2.4	are all found on your body.	NA
thag16.6:3.1	Your eyes are clear, your face is fair,	NA
thag16.6:3.2	you’re formidable, upright, majestic.	NA
thag16.6:3.3	In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics,	NA
thag16.6:3.4	you shine like the sun.	NA
thag16.6:4.1	You’re a mendicant fine to see,	NA
thag16.6:4.2	with skin that shines like lustrous gold.	NA
thag16.6:4.3	But with such excellent appearance,	NA
thag16.6:4.4	what do you want with the ascetic life?	NA
thag16.6:5.1	You’re fit to be a king,	NA
thag16.6:5.2	a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers,	NA
thag16.6:5.3	victorious in the four quarters,	NA
thag16.6:5.4	lord of the Black Plum Tree Land.	NA
thag16.6:6.1	Aristocrats, nobles, and kings	NA
thag16.6:6.2	ought follow your rule.	NA
thag16.6:6.3	Gotama, you should reign	NA
thag16.6:6.4	as king of kings, lord of mankind!”	NA
thag16.6:7.1	“I am a king, Sela”,	NA
thag16.6:7.2	said the Buddha to Sela,	NA
thag16.6:7.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
thag16.6:7.4	By the teaching I roll forth the wheel	NA
thag16.6:7.5	which cannot be rolled back.”	This is of course a reference to the first sermon ([sn56.11]()).
thag16.6:8.1	“You claim to be awakened,”	NA
thag16.6:8.2	said Sela the brahmin,	NA
thag16.6:8.3	“the supreme king of the teaching.	NA
thag16.6:8.4	‘I roll forth the teaching’:	NA
thag16.6:8.5	so you say, Gotama.	NA
thag16.6:9.1	Then who is your general,	The title “General of the Dhamma” belongs to Sāriputta ([ud2.8:16.2](), [thag18.1:33.1]()).
thag16.6:9.2	the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way?	NA
thag16.6:9.3	Who keeps rolling the wheel	NA
thag16.6:9.4	of the teaching you rolled forth?”	NA
thag16.6:10.1	“By me the wheel was rolled forth,”	NA
thag16.6:10.2	said the Buddha,	NA
thag16.6:10.3	“the supreme wheel of the teaching.	NA
thag16.6:10.4	Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One,	NA
thag16.6:10.5	keeps it rolling on.	_Anujāta_ is said at [iti74:4.1]() to be a child who “takes after” the good qualities of their parents.
thag16.6:11.1	I have known what should be known,	As at [mn91:31.5]().
thag16.6:11.2	and developed what should be developed,	NA
thag16.6:11.3	and given up what should be given up:	NA
thag16.6:11.4	and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.	NA
thag16.6:12.1	Dispel your doubt in me—	NA
thag16.6:12.2	make up your mind, brahmin!	NA
thag16.6:12.3	The sight of a Buddha	NA
thag16.6:12.4	is hard to find again.	_Abhiṇhaso_ means “repeatedly”. Here the force of the saying is, I think, “It is hard enough to encounter a Buddha even once, let alone repeatedly.”
thag16.6:13.1	I am a Buddha, brahmin,	NA
thag16.6:13.2	the supreme surgeon,	NA
thag16.6:13.3	one of those whose appearance in the world	NA

thag16.6:15.1	“Pay heed, sirs, to what	NA
thag16.6:15.2	is spoken by the Clear-eyed One.	NA
thag16.6:15.3	The surgeon, the great hero,	NA
thag16.6:15.4	roars like a lion in the jungle.	NA
thag16.6:16.1	A manifestation of divinity, unequaled,	NA
thag16.6:16.2	crusher of Māra’s army;	NA
thag16.6:16.3	who would not be inspired by him,	NA
thag16.6:16.4	even one born in a dark class?	The “dark class” refers to those born in an unfortunate state ([an6.57:11.1]()). Sela is saying that the Buddha’s path is for everyone, not just the fortunate.
thag16.6:17.1	Those who wish may follow me;	NA
thag16.6:17.2	those who don’t may go.	NA
thag16.6:17.3	Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence,	NA

thag16.6:18.1	“Sir, if you endorse	NA
thag16.6:18.2	the teaching of the Buddha,	NA
thag16.6:18.3	we’ll also go forth in his presence,	NA

thag16.6:19.1	“These three hundred brahmins	NA

thag16.6:19.3	‘May we lead the spiritual life	NA
thag16.6:19.4	in your presence, Blessed One?’”	NA
thag16.6:20.1	“The spiritual life is well explained,”	NA
thag16.6:20.2	said the Buddha,	NA
thag16.6:20.3	“apparent in the present life, immediately effective.	NA
thag16.6:20.4	Here the going forth isn’t in vain	NA

thag16.6:22.1	You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,	This verse and the next are also at [snp3.6:49.1]().

thag16.6:23.1	You have transcended attachments,	NA

thag16.8:0.4	Aṅgulimāla	NA
thag16.8:1.1	“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’	The story of Aṅgulimāla is told in more detail in [mn86](), which includes most of the verses found here.
thag16.8:1.2	And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.	NA
thag16.8:1.3	I’m asking you this, ascetic:	NA
thag16.8:1.4	how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”	NA
thag16.8:2.1	“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—	NA
thag16.8:2.2	I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.	NA
thag16.8:2.3	But you can’t stop yourself <j>from harming living creatures;	NA
thag16.8:2.4	that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”	NA
thag16.8:3.1	“Oh, at long last a renowned great seer,	NA
thag16.8:3.2	an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood.	NA
thag16.8:3.3	Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,	NA
thag16.8:3.4	I shall discard a thousand evils.”	NA
thag16.8:4.1	With these words, <j>the bandit hurled his sword and weapons	NA
thag16.8:4.2	down a cliff into an abyss.	NA
thag16.8:4.3	He venerated the Holy One’s feet,	NA
thag16.8:4.4	and asked the Buddha for the going forth right away.	NA
thag16.8:5.1	Then the Buddha, the compassionate great seer,	NA
thag16.8:5.2	the teacher of the world with its gods,	NA
thag16.8:5.3	said to him, “Come, monk!”	NA
thag16.8:5.4	And with that he became a monk.	NA
thag16.8:6.1	“He who once was heedless,	NA

thag16.10:8.1	That’s why they inspired confidence,	NA

thag16.10:22.2	by such means	NA
thag16.10:22.3	they accumulate a lot of wealth	NA
thag16.10:22.4	for the sake of their own livelihood.	NA
thag16.10:23.1	They assemble the community	NA
thag16.10:23.2	for business rather than Dhamma.	NA
thag16.10:23.3	They teach the Dhamma to others	NA
thag16.10:23.4	for gain, not for the goal.	NA
thag16.10:24.1	Those barred from the Saṅgha	NA
thag16.10:24.2	quarrel over the Saṅgha’s property.	NA

thag16.10:27.1	When shoeless on a thorny path,	NA

thag17.1:1.3	the seer of the Paṇḍara clan,	No _paṇḍara_ clan is known elsewhere. Given that the text goes on to discuss robe colors of mendicants, the name, which means “white”, probably refers to ascetics wearing white robes, the _pāṇḍarabhikṣu_ of Yaśomitra’s Sphuṭārthā Abhidharmakośavyākhyā 300 and Mahāvyutpatti 179. Soma is exalted as “white-robed” (_pāṇḍaravāsa_) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.3.

thag17.1:6.1	In the future	NA

thag17.1:7.3	will become powerful	NA
thag17.1:7.4	in running Saṅgha proceedings.	This is probably an indirect reference to the Second Council, where one of the difficulties was ensuring the proceedings were carried out by monks on integrity.

thag19.1:18.2	“On the Mountainfold, the birds with colorful wings,	NA
thag19.1:18.3	greeting the thunder, Mahinda’s voice,	Mahinda is “Great Indra”, the god of thunder.

thag19.1:19.1	In my family circle, friends, loved ones, and relatives;	NA

thag19.1:19.4	and even then you’re not content with me, mind!	NA
thag19.1:20.1	This is mine alone, it doesn’t belong to others;	NA
thag19.1:20.2	when it is time to don your armor, why lament?	NA
thag19.1:20.3	Observing that all this is unstable,	NA
thag19.1:20.4	I went forth, seeking the state free of death.	NA
thag19.1:21.1	The methodical teacher, supreme among people,	NA

thag19.1:22.1	Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful;	NA
thag19.1:22.2	an ignorant ordinary person is bound to them.	NA
thag19.1:22.3	Seeking to be reborn again, they wish for suffering;	NA
thag19.1:22.4	led on by their mind, they’re relegated to hell.	NA
thag19.1:23.1	“Staying in the grove resounding with cries	NA

thag19.1:23.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:24.1	“Develop the absorptions and spiritual faculties,	NA
thag19.1:24.2	the powers, awakening factors, and immersion;	NA
thag19.1:24.3	realize the three knowledges <j>in the teaching of the Buddha!”	NA
thag19.1:24.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:25.1	“Develop the eightfold path <j>to realize freedom from death	NA
thag19.1:25.2	emancipating, plunging into the end of all suffering,	NA
thag19.1:25.3	and cleansing all defilements!”	NA
thag19.1:25.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:26.1	“Reflect rationally on the aggregates as suffering,	NA
thag19.1:26.2	and abandon that from which suffering arises;	NA
thag19.1:26.3	make an end of suffering in this very life!”	NA
thag19.1:26.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:27.1	“Rationally discern that impermanence is suffering,	NA
thag19.1:27.2	that emptiness is non-self, and that misery is death.	NA
thag19.1:27.3	Uproot the wandering mind!”	NA
thag19.1:27.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:28.1	“Bald, unsightly, accursed,	NA
thag19.1:28.2	seek alms amongst families, bowl in hand.	NA
thag19.1:28.3	Devote yourself to the word of the teacher, <j>the great seer!”	NA
thag19.1:28.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:29.1	“Wander the streets well-restrained,	NA
thag19.1:29.2	mentally unsnared to families and sensual pleasures,	NA
thag19.1:29.3	like the full moon on a bright night!”	NA
thag19.1:29.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:30.1	“Be a wilderness-dweller and an alms-eater,	NA
thag19.1:30.2	one who lives in charnel grounds, a rag-robe wearer,	NA
thag19.1:30.3	one who never lies down, <j>always delighting in ascetic practices.”	NA
thag19.1:30.4	So you used to urge me, mind.	NA
thag19.1:31.1	Mind, when you urge me to the impermanent and unstable,	NA
thag19.1:31.2	you’re acting like someone who plants trees,	NA
thag19.1:31.3	then, when they’re about to fruit,	NA
thag19.1:31.4	wishes to cut down the very same trees.	NA
thag19.1:32.1	Incorporeal mind, far-traveler, lone-wanderer:	NA
thag19.1:32.2	I won’t do your bidding any more.	NA
thag19.1:32.3	Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, <j>and very dangerous;	NA
thag19.1:32.4	I’ll wander with my mind <j>focused only on extinguishment.	NA
thag19.1:33.1	I didn’t go forth due to bad luck or shamelessness,	NA
thag19.1:33.2	or due to a whim or banishment,	NA
thag19.1:33.3	nor for the sake of a livelihood;	NA
thag19.1:33.4	it was because I agreed <j>to the promise you made, mind.	NA
thag19.1:34.1	“Having few wishes, abandoning disparagement,	NA
thag19.1:34.2	the stilling of suffering: <j>these are praised by true persons.”	NA
thag19.1:34.3	So you used to urge me, mind,	NA
thag19.1:34.4	but now you keep on with your old habits!	NA
thag19.1:35.1	Craving, ignorance, the loved and unloved,	NA
thag19.1:35.2	pretty sights, pleasant feelings,	NA
thag19.1:35.3	and the delightful kinds of sensual stimulation:	NA
thag19.1:35.4	I’ve vomited them up, I can’t swallow them back.	NA
thag19.1:36.1	I’ve done your bidding everywhere, mind!	NA
thag19.1:36.2	For many births, I’ve done nothing to upset you.	NA
thag19.1:36.3	Yet the creation in myself <j>is because of your ingratitude—	Read _akataññutāya_. The “creation in myself” (_ajjhattasambhavo_) is craving.
thag19.1:36.4	for a long time I’ve transmigrated <j>in the suffering you’ve made.	NA
thag19.1:37.1	Only you, mind, make a brahmin;	NA
thag19.1:37.2	you make an aristocrat or a royal seer.	NA
thag19.1:37.3	Sometimes we become peasants or menials;	NA
thag19.1:37.4	and life as a god is also on account of you.	NA
thag19.1:38.1	You alone make us titans;	NA
thag19.1:38.2	because of you we’re born in hell.	NA
thag19.1:38.3	Then sometimes we become animals,	NA
thag19.1:38.4	and life as a ghost is also on account of you.	NA
thag19.1:39.1	Come what may, you won’t betray me again,	NA
thag19.1:39.2	dazzling me with your ever-changing display!	NA
thag19.1:39.3	You play with me like I’m mad—	NA
thag19.1:39.4	but how have I ever failed you, mind?	NA
thag19.1:40.1	In the past my mind wandered	NA
thag19.1:40.2	how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.	NA
thag19.1:40.3	Now I’ll carefully guide it,	NA
thag19.1:40.4	as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant.	NA
thag19.1:41.1	The teacher willed that this world appear to me	NA
thag19.1:41.2	as impermanent, unstable, insubstantial.	NA
thag19.1:41.3	Mind, let me leap into the victor’s teaching,	NA
thag19.1:41.4	carry me over the great flood, so hard to pass.	NA
thag19.1:42.1	Things have changed, mind!	NA
thag19.1:42.2	Nothing could make me return to your control!	NA
thag19.1:42.3	I’ve gone forth in the teaching of the great seer,	NA
thag19.1:42.4	those like me don’t come to ruin.	NA
thag19.1:43.1	Mountains, oceans, rivers, the earth;	NA
thag19.1:43.2	the four quarters, the intermediate directions, <j>below and in the sky;	NA
thag19.1:43.3	the three realms of existence <j>are all impermanent and troubled—	NA
thag19.1:43.4	where can you go to find happiness, mind?	NA
thag19.1:44.1	Mind, what will you do to someone <j>who has made the ultimate commitment?	NA
thag19.1:44.2	Nothing could make me a follower <j>under your control, mind;	NA
thag19.1:44.3	I’d never touch a bellows <j>with a mouth open at each end;	NA
thag19.1:44.4	curse this mortal frame flowing with nine streams!	NA
thag19.1:45.1	You’ve ascended the mountain peak, <j>full of nature’s beauty,	NA
thag19.1:45.2	frequented by boars and antelopes,	NA
thag19.1:45.3	a grove sprinkled with fresh water in the monsoon;	NA
thag19.1:45.4	and there you’ll be happy in your cave-home.	NA
thag19.1:46.1	Peacocks with beautiful necks and crests,	NA
thag19.1:46.2	colorful tail-feathers and wings,	NA
thag19.1:46.3	crying out at the resounding thunder:	NA
thag19.1:46.4	they’ll delight you as you meditate in the forest.	NA
thag19.1:47.1	When the heavens have rained, <j>and the grass is four inches high,	NA
thag19.1:47.2	and the grove is full of flowers like a cloud,	NA
thag19.1:47.3	between the mountains, like the fork of a tree, I’ll lie;	NA
thag19.1:47.4	it will be as soft as cotton-buds.	NA
thag19.1:48.1	I’ll act as a master does:	NA
thag19.1:48.2	let whatever I get be enough for me.	NA
thag19.1:48.3	And that’s why I’ll make you as supple	NA
thag19.1:48.4	as a tireless worker makes a cat-skin bag.	NA
thag19.1:49.1	I’ll act as a master does:	NA
thag19.1:49.2	let whatever I get be enough for me.	NA
thag19.1:49.3	I’ll control you with my energy,	NA
thag19.1:49.4	as a skilled trainer controls an elephant with a hook.	NA
thag19.1:50.1	Now that you’re well-tamed and reliable,	NA
thag19.1:50.2	I can use you, <j>like a trainer uses a straight-running horse,	NA
thag19.1:50.3	to practice the path so full of grace,	NA
thag19.1:50.4	cultivated by those who take care of their minds.	NA
thag19.1:51.1	I shall strongly fasten you to a meditation subject,	NA
thag19.1:51.2	as an elephant is tied to a post with firm rope.	NA
thag19.1:51.3	You’ll be well-guarded by me, <j>well-developed by mindfulness,	NA
thag19.1:51.4	and unattached to rebirth in all states of existence.	NA
thag19.1:52.1	With wisdom you’ll cut short <j>the one following the wrong path,	NA
thag19.1:52.2	curb them by practice, <j>and settle them on the right path.	NA
thag19.1:52.3	Having seen arising and passing away <j>with respect to the cause of suffering,	Take _samudayaṁ_ as accusative of relation, equivalent to locative (although treated as genitive in commentary).
thag19.1:52.4	you’ll be an heir to the greatest teacher.	NA
thag19.1:53.1	Under the sway of the four distortions, mind,	NA
thag19.1:53.2	you dragged me around like a bull in a pit;	NA
thag19.1:53.3	but now you won’t associate <j>with the great sage of compassion,	NA
thag19.1:53.4	the cutter of fetters and bonds?	NA
thag19.1:54.1	Like a deer roaming free in the colorful forest,	NA
thag19.1:54.2	I’ll ascend the lovely mountain <j>wreathed in monsoon clouds,	NA
thag19.1:54.3	and rejoice to be on that hill, free of folk—	NA
thag19.1:54.4	there is no doubt you’ll perish, mind.	NA
thag19.1:55.1	The men and women who live <j>under your will and command,	NA
thag19.1:55.2	whatever pleasure they experience,	NA
thag19.1:55.3	they are ignorant and fall under Māra’s control;	NA
thag19.1:55.4	loving life, they’re your disciples, mind.	NA

thag21.1:63.2	restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma!	NA
thag21.1:63.3	For ordinary people <j>have no wish-granter,	_Kāmakāro_: “wish-granter”. Ordinary people cannot simply get what they want.
thag21.1:63.4	but Realized Ones <j>have a comprehensibility-granter.	_Saṅkheyyakāro_: “comprehensibility-granter”. _Saṅkheyya_ is “calculable, comprehensible”, not “after comprehension”. The Buddha has a gift for explaining things in a way that makes them comprehensible.

thig1.11:1.3	the mortar, the pestle,	The mortar and pestle feature prominently in the sexual imagery of Rig Veda 1.29, where the kitchen implements are analogized with the pressing of soma on the altar. Both _musala_ and “pestle” derive from roots “to pound”.

thig2.8:2.3	The fever of passion is cut off,	NA

The Therīgāthā commentary offers two explanations, the second of which appears to lean on a version of the line similar to that found in SN 5.5.

They are spirits of nature, hidden in the mountains, and threatened by human encroachment ([ja485]()). Occasionally, however, a human tribe in the mountains of Kashmir is called Kinnara (= Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh?). | The beauty of the pixie’s eyes are praised at [ja458:1.3](), while the phrase “captivating eyes” (_mandalocana_) is used of a divine maiden at [dn21:1.5.26]().

thig15.1:22.4	virtuous and doing no wrong.	NA
thig15.1:23.1	My father then spoke to a beggar for alms,	NA
thig15.1:23.2	a tamer of others and of himself:	NA
thig15.1:23.3	‘Be my son-in-law;	NA
thig15.1:23.4	set aside your tonsure-cloth and pot.’	_Poṭṭhi_ is unique in Pali, and evidently represents the Sanskrit _pauṣṭika_, a robe used for the tonsure ceremony. Also, the father uses _ghaṭika_ (“pot”) rather than the familiar _patta_ (“bowl”).
thig15.1:24.1	He stayed a fortnight before he said to my dad:	NA
thig15.1:24.2	‘Give me back my tonsure-cloth,	NA
thig15.1:24.3	my pot and my mug—	For _mallaka_ as “mug” see [an3.100:4.1]().
thig15.1:24.4	I’ll wander begging again.’	NA
thig15.1:25.1	So then my mum and my dad	NA
thig15.1:25.2	and my whole group of relatives said:	NA
thig15.1:25.3	‘What has not been done for you here?	NA
thig15.1:25.4	Quickly, tell us what we can do for you!’	NA
thig15.1:26.1	When they spoke to him like this he said,	NA
thig15.1:26.2	‘If I can make do for myself, that is enough.	NA
thig15.1:26.3	I can’t stand to live together with Isidāsī	NA
thig15.1:26.4	staying in the same house.’	NA
thig15.1:27.1	Released, he left.	NA
thig15.1:27.2	But I sat all alone contemplating:	NA
thig15.1:27.3	‘Having taken my leave, I’ll go,	NA
thig15.1:27.4	either to die or to go forth.’	NA
thig15.1:28.1	But then Mistress Jinadattā,	NA
thig15.1:28.2	learned and virtuous,	NA
thig15.1:28.3	who had memorized the monastic law,	NA
thig15.1:28.4	came resorting to my dad’s house for alms.	NA
thig15.1:29.1	When I saw her,	NA
thig15.1:29.2	I got up from my seat and prepared it for her.	NA
thig15.1:29.3	When she had taken her seat,	NA
thig15.1:29.4	I honored her feet and offered her a meal,	NA
thig15.1:30.1	satisfying her with food and drink,	NA
thig15.1:30.2	treats, or whatever was in the cupboard.	NA
thig15.1:30.3	Then I said:	NA
thig15.1:30.4	‘Ma’am, I wish to go forth!’	NA
thig15.1:31.1	But my dad said to me:	NA
thig15.1:31.2	‘Child, practice Dhamma right here!	NA
thig15.1:31.3	With food and drink	NA
thig15.1:31.4	satisfy ascetics and the twice-born.’	“Twice-born” (_dvijātī_) is an epithet of brahmins, referring to material and spiritual births. It is normally found only in later literature, and this might be the first recorded usage of the idiom.
thig15.1:32.1	Then I said to my dad,	NA
thig15.1:32.2	crying, my joined palms raised to him:	NA
thig15.1:32.3	‘I’ve done bad things in the past;	NA
thig15.1:32.4	I shall wear that bad deed away.’	NA
thig15.1:33.1	And my dad said to me:	NA
thig15.1:33.2	‘May you attain awakening, the highest state,	NA
thig15.1:33.3	and may you find the extinguishment	NA
thig15.1:33.4	that was realized by the best of men!’	NA
thig15.1:34.1	I bowed down to my mother and father,	NA
thig15.1:34.2	and my whole group of relatives;	NA
thig15.1:34.3	and then, seven days after going forth,	NA
thig15.1:34.4	I realized the three knowledges.	NA
thig15.1:35.1	I know my last seven lives;	NA
thig15.1:35.2	I shall relate to you the deeds	NA
thig15.1:35.3	of which this life is the fruit and result:	NA
thig15.1:35.4	focus your whole mind on that.	NA
thig15.1:36.1	In the city of Erakacca	NA
thig15.1:36.2	I was a goldsmith with lots of money.	NA
thig15.1:36.3	Drunk on the pride of youth,	NA
thig15.1:36.4	I had sex with someone else’s wife.	NA
thig15.1:37.1	Having passed away from there,	NA
thig15.1:37.2	I burned in hell for a long time.	NA
thig15.1:37.3	Rising up from there	NA
thig15.1:37.4	I was conceived in a monkey’s womb.	NA
thig15.1:38.1	When I was only seven days old,	NA
thig15.1:38.2	I was castrated by the monkey chief.	NA
thig15.1:38.3	This was the fruit of that deed,	NA
thig15.1:38.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.	NA
thig15.1:39.1	Having passed away from there,	NA
thig15.1:39.2	passing away in Sindhava grove,	NA
thig15.1:39.3	I was conceived in the womb	NA
thig15.1:39.4	of a lame, one-eyed she-goat.	NA
thig15.1:40.1	I carried children on my back for twelve years,	NA
thig15.1:40.2	and all the while I was castrated,	NA
thig15.1:40.3	worm-eaten, and tail-less,	NA
thig15.1:40.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.	NA
thig15.1:41.1	Having passed away from there,	NA
thig15.1:41.2	I was reborn in a cow	NA
thig15.1:41.3	owned by a cattle merchant.	NA
thig15.1:41.4	A red calf, castrated, for twelve months	NA
thig15.1:42.1	I drew a big plow.	NA
thig15.1:42.2	I shouldered a cart,	NA
thig15.1:42.3	blind, tail-less, feeble,	NA
thig15.1:42.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.	NA
thig15.1:43.1	Having passed away from there,	NA
thig15.1:43.2	I was born of a slave in the street,	NA
thig15.1:43.3	with neither male nor female parts,	The text is literally “neither woman nor man”. The preceding verses speak repeatedly of castration, making it clear that this means having no genitals, rather than simply being a person who is non-binary.
thig15.1:43.4	because of adultery with another’s wife.	NA
thig15.1:44.1	I died at thirty years of age,	NA
thig15.1:44.2	and was reborn as a girl in a carter’s family.	NA
thig15.1:44.3	We were poor, of little wealth,	NA
thig15.1:44.4	greatly oppressed by creditors.	NA
thig15.1:45.1	Because of the huge interest we owed,	NA
thig15.1:45.2	I was dragged away screaming,	NA
thig15.1:45.3	taken by force from the family home	NA
thig15.1:45.4	by a caravan leader.	NA
thig15.1:46.1	When I was sixteen years old,	NA
thig15.1:46.2	seeing I was a girl of marriageable age,	For _pattayobbanaṁ_ as “come of age”, i.e. old enough to have sex, see [ja532:80.4]().
thig15.1:46.3	his son confined me as his wife—	Like an ox in a pen ([an6.60:3.1]()).
thig15.1:46.4	Giridāsa was his name.	NA
thig15.1:47.1	He also had another wife,	NA
thig15.1:47.2	a virtuous and well-known lady of quality,	NA
thig15.1:47.3	loyal to her husband;	NA
thig15.1:47.4	yet I stirred up resentment in her.	NA
thig15.1:48.1	As the fruit of that deed,	NA
thig15.1:48.2	they abandoned me and left,	NA
thig15.1:48.3	though I served them like a slave.	NA

thig16.1:1.1	In Mantāvatī city, Sumedhā,	NA
thig16.1:1.2	the daughter of King Koñca’s chief queen,	NA
thig16.1:1.3	was converted by those	NA
thig16.1:1.4	who practice the Buddha’s teaching.	NA
thig16.1:2.1	She was virtuous, a brilliant speaker,	NA

thig16.1:2.3	She went up to her mother and father and said:	NA
thig16.1:2.4	“Pay heed, both of you!	NA
thig16.1:3.1	I delight in extinguishment!	NA
thig16.1:3.2	No life is eternal, not even that of the gods;	NA

thig16.1:3.4	offering little gratification and much distress.	NA
thig16.1:4.1	Sensual pleasures are bitter as the venom of a snake,	NA
thig16.1:4.2	yet fools are infatuated by them.	NA
thig16.1:4.3	Sent to hell for a very long time,	NA

thig16.1:5.1	Those who grow in wickedness	NA

thig16.1:5.3	They’re fools, unrestrained in body,	NA

thig16.1:6.1	Those witless, senseless fools,	NA
thig16.1:6.2	trapped by the origin of suffering,	NA
thig16.1:6.3	are ignorant, not understanding the noble truths	NA

thig16.1:7.1	Most people, mum, ignorant of the truths	NA
thig16.1:7.2	taught by the excellent Buddha,	NA
thig16.1:7.3	look forward to the next life,	NA

thig16.1:8.1	Yet even rebirth among the gods	NA
thig16.1:8.2	in an impermanent state is not eternal.	NA
thig16.1:8.3	But fools are not scared	NA
thig16.1:8.4	of being reborn time and again.	NA
thig16.1:9.1	Four lower realms and two other realms	NA
thig16.1:9.2	may be gained somehow or other.	NA
thig16.1:9.3	But for those who end up in a lower realm,	NA

thig16.1:10.3	Living at ease, I shall apply myself	NA

thig16.1:12.3	As long as I live I’ll never betray	NA

thig16.1:13.1	Then Sumedhā said to her parents:	NA
thig16.1:13.2	“So long as I remain a lay person,	NA
thig16.1:13.3	I’ll refuse to eat any food,	NA
thig16.1:13.4	until I’ve fallen under the sway of death.”	NA
thig16.1:14.1	Upset, her mother burst into tears,	NA
thig16.1:14.2	while her father, though grieved,	NA
thig16.1:14.3	tried his best to persuade her	NA
thig16.1:14.4	as she lay collapsed upstairs in the longhouse.	NA
thig16.1:15.1	“Get up child, why do you grieve so?	NA
thig16.1:15.2	You’re already betrothed to be married!	NA

thig16.1:16.3	Ethical precepts, the chaste path—	NA
thig16.1:16.4	going forth is hard to do, my child.	NA
thig16.1:17.1	As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,	NA
thig16.1:17.2	and the happiness of possessions.	NA
thig16.1:17.3	Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!	NA
thig16.1:17.4	Let your wedding take place, my child!”	NA

thig16.1:18.4	but I shall never marry.	NA
thig16.1:19.1	Why cling to this rotting body so foul,	NA
thig16.1:19.2	stinking of fluids,	NA
thig16.1:19.3	a horrifying water-bag carcass,	NA

thig16.1:22.1	When they’ve tossed it away in the charnel ground,	NA
thig16.1:22.2	to be eaten by others, your own parents	NA
thig16.1:22.3	bathe themselves, disgusted;	NA
thig16.1:22.4	what then of people at large?	NA
thig16.1:23.1	They’re attached to this hollow carcass,	NA
thig16.1:23.2	this mass of sinews and bone;	NA
thig16.1:23.3	this rotting body	NA
thig16.1:23.4	full of saliva, tears, feces, and pus.	NA
thig16.1:24.1	If anyone were to dissect it,	NA
thig16.1:24.2	turning it inside out,	NA
thig16.1:24.3	the unbearable stench	NA
thig16.1:24.4	would disgust even their own mother.	NA
thig16.1:25.1	Rationally examining	NA
thig16.1:25.2	the aggregates, elements, and sense fields	NA
thig16.1:25.3	as conditioned, rooted in birth, suffering—	NA
thig16.1:25.4	why would I wish for marriage?	NA
thig16.1:26.1	Let three hundred sharp swords	NA
thig16.1:26.2	fall on my body everyday!	NA
thig16.1:26.3	Even if the slaughter lasted a hundred years	NA
thig16.1:26.4	it’d be worth it if it led to the end of suffering.	NA
thig16.1:27.1	One who understands the Teacher’s words	NA
thig16.1:27.2	would put up with this slaughter:	NA
thig16.1:27.3	‘Long for you is transmigration	NA
thig16.1:27.4	being killed time and time again.’	NA
thig16.1:28.1	Among gods and humans,	NA
thig16.1:28.2	in the realm of animals or that of titans,	NA
thig16.1:28.3	among the ghosts or in the hells,	NA
thig16.1:28.4	endless killings are seen.	NA
thig16.1:29.1	The hells are full of killing,	NA
thig16.1:29.2	for the corrupt who have fallen to the underworld.	NA
thig16.1:29.3	Even among the gods there is no shelter,	NA
thig16.1:29.4	for no happiness excels extinguishment.	NA
thig16.1:30.1	Those who are committed to the dispensation	NA
thig16.1:30.2	of him of the ten powers attain extinguishment.	NA
thig16.1:30.3	Living at ease, they apply themselves	NA
thig16.1:30.4	to giving up rebirth and death.	NA
thig16.1:31.1	On this very day, dad, I shall renounce:	NA
thig16.1:31.2	what’s to enjoy in hollow riches?	NA
thig16.1:31.3	I’m disillusioned with sensual pleasures,	NA
thig16.1:31.4	they’re like vomit, made like a palm stump.”	NA
thig16.1:32.1	As she spoke thus to her father,	NA
thig16.1:32.2	Anīkaratta, to whom she was betrothed,	NA
thig16.1:32.3	approached from Vāraṇavatī	NA
thig16.1:32.4	at the time appointed for the marriage.	NA
thig16.1:33.1	Then Sumedhā took up a knife,	NA
thig16.1:33.2	and cut off her hair, so black, thick, and soft.	NA
thig16.1:33.3	Shutting herself in the longhouse,	NA
thig16.1:33.4	she entered the first absorption.	NA
thig16.1:34.1	And as she entered it there,	NA
thig16.1:34.2	Anīkaratta arrived at the city.	NA
thig16.1:34.3	Then in the longhouse, Sumedhā	NA
thig16.1:34.4	well developed the perception of impermanence.	NA
thig16.1:35.1	As she investigated in meditation,	NA
thig16.1:35.2	Anīkaratta quickly climbed the stairs.	NA
thig16.1:35.3	His limbs adorned with gems <j>and honey-yellow gold,	NA
thig16.1:35.4	he begged Sumedhā with joined palms:	NA
thig16.1:36.1	“As a royal there is command, wealth, authority,	NA
thig16.1:36.2	and the happiness of possessions.	NA
thig16.1:36.3	Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young!	NA
thig16.1:36.4	Sensual pleasures are hard to find in the world!	NA
thig16.1:37.1	I’ve handed royalty to you—	NA
thig16.1:37.2	enjoy riches, give gifts!	NA
thig16.1:37.3	Don’t be sad;	NA
thig16.1:37.4	your parents are upset.”	NA
thig16.1:38.1	Sumedhā, having no use for sensual pleasures,	NA
thig16.1:38.2	and having done away with delusion, <j>spoke right back:	NA
thig16.1:38.3	“Do not take pleasure in sensuality!	NA
thig16.1:38.4	See the danger in sensual pleasures!	NA
thig16.1:39.1	Mandhātā, king of four continents,	NA
thig16.1:39.2	foremost in enjoying sensual pleasures,	NA
thig16.1:39.3	died unsated,	NA
thig16.1:39.4	his desires unfulfilled.	NA
thig16.1:40.1	Were the seven jewels to rain from the sky	NA
thig16.1:40.2	all over the ten directions,	NA
thig16.1:40.3	there would be no sating of sensual pleasures:	NA
thig16.1:40.4	people die insatiable.	NA
thig16.1:41.1	Like a butcher’s knife and chopping board,	NA
thig16.1:41.2	sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head.	NA
thig16.1:41.3	They burn like a fire-brand,	NA
thig16.1:41.4	they resemble a skeleton.	NA
thig16.1:42.1	Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable,	NA
thig16.1:42.2	they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison;	NA
thig16.1:42.3	like a hot iron ball,	NA
thig16.1:42.4	the root of misery, their fruit is pain.	NA
thig16.1:43.1	Sensual pleasures are like fruits of a tree,	NA
thig16.1:43.2	like scraps of meat, painful,	NA
thig16.1:43.3	they trick you like a dream;	NA
thig16.1:43.4	sensual pleasures are like borrowed goods.	NA
thig16.1:44.1	Sensual pleasures are like swords and spears;	NA
thig16.1:44.2	a disease, a boil, misery and trouble.	NA
thig16.1:44.3	Like a pit of glowing coals,	NA
thig16.1:44.4	the root of misery, fear and slaughter.	NA
thig16.1:45.1	Thus sensual pleasures have been explained	NA
thig16.1:45.2	to be obstructions, so full of suffering.	NA
thig16.1:45.3	Please leave! As for me,	NA
thig16.1:45.4	I have no trust in a new life.	NA
thig16.1:46.1	What can someone else do for me	NA
thig16.1:46.2	when their own head is burning?	NA
thig16.1:46.3	When stalked by old age and death,	NA
thig16.1:46.4	you should strive to destroy them.”	NA
thig16.1:47.1	She opened the door	NA
thig16.1:47.2	and saw her parents with Anīkaratta,	NA
thig16.1:47.3	sitting crying on the floor.	NA
thig16.1:47.4	And so she said this:	NA
thig16.1:48.1	“Transmigration is long for fools,	NA
thig16.1:48.2	crying again and again <j>at that with no known beginning—	NA
thig16.1:48.3	the death of a father,	NA
thig16.1:48.4	the killing of a brother or of themselves.	NA
thig16.1:49.1	Remember the ocean of tears, of milk, of blood—	NA
thig16.1:49.2	transmigration with no known beginning.	NA

thig16.1:51.1	Transmigration with no known beginning	NA
thig16.1:51.2	is compared to this broad Black Plum Tree Land;	NA
thig16.1:51.3	if divided into lumps the size of jujube seeds,	NA
thig16.1:51.4	they’d still be fewer than his mother’s mothers.	NA
thig16.1:52.1	Remember the grass, sticks, and leaves,	NA
thig16.1:52.2	compare that with no known beginning:	NA
thig16.1:52.3	if split into chips four inches in size,	NA
thig16.1:52.4	they’d still be fewer than his father’s fathers.	NA
thig16.1:53.1	Remember the one-eyed turtle <j>and the yoke with a hole	NA
thig16.1:53.2	blown in the ocean from east to west—	NA
thig16.1:53.3	sticking the head in the hole	NA
thig16.1:53.4	is a metaphor for gaining a human birth.	NA
thig16.1:54.1	Remember the form of this unlucky body,	NA
thig16.1:54.2	insubstantial as a lump of foam.	NA
thig16.1:54.3	See the aggregates as impermanent,	NA
thig16.1:54.4	remember the hells so full of distress.	NA

ud1.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 1.4	NA
ud1.4:0.2	The Mystic Syllable Huṁ	NA
ud1.4:1.1	So I have heard.	This episode also appears at [pli-tv-kd1:2.1.1](). Sharing three distinctive terms—_huṁ_, _brahmavāda_, _kāsāva_—with the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, it can be read as a rebuttal of the Chāndogya’s special emphasis on the mystic power of Vedic ritual utterances (_sāman_).
ud1.4:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
ud1.4:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.	NA
ud1.4:1.4	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion.	NA
ud1.4:2.1	Then a certain brahmin, one of those who murmured the mystic syllable _huṁ_, _huṁ_, went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.	_Huṁhuṅkajātiko brāhmaṇo_ is literally, “a brahmin of the _huṁ_, _huṁ_ sort”. The significance of this is revealed in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.13, which lists twelve mystic syllables (_stobha_) that are uttered during the recitation of the _sāman_ hymn. The thirteenth and final syllable is _huṁ_, said to be variable and “indistinct” (_anirukta_). It contains the last and most closed-off of the cardinal vowels (_u_), which creates an indistinct mumble, reflecting the undefined nature of the primordial divinity. Its significance is underlined by the fact that it is called it the _upaniṣad_, the “hidden connection” (1.14). _Huṁ_ is found fairly often in later Hindu texts, even receiving its own Hūṅkāra Tantra; occasionally we find the redoubled form as here (eg. Bṛhatkathāślokasaṁgraha 21.146). It made its way into such Tibetan texts as the Ḍākārṇava Tantra, where it is said to be recited at the end, reflecting its phonetic quality exactly as in the Upaniṣad. It is recognizable today as the final syllable in the mantra, _om mani padme hum_.
ud1.4:2.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said,	NA
ud1.4:2.3	“Worthy Gotama, how do you define a brahmin? And what are the things that make one a brahmin?”	NA
ud1.4:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud1.4:4.1	“Any brahmin who has banished bad qualities—	This pun is explained at [mn39:24.2]().
ud1.4:4.2	not murmuring the mystic syllable _huṁ_, <j>unstained, self-controlled,	“Unstained” is from _kasāva_, which occurs in the same sense at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 (_mṛditakaṣāyāya_).
ud1.4:4.3	a complete knowledge master <j>who has completed the spiritual journey—	The “knowledge” in _vedagū_ is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. It is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. | For _vūsitabrahmacariyo_ (“completed the spiritual journey”) compare _uṣitvā brahmacaryaṁ_ at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.2.1.
ud1.4:4.4	they may legitimately proclaim the divine doctrine;	This, the only occurrence of _brahmavāda_ in Pali, harks back to the brahmin’s role as a reciter of the _sāman_. In Brahmanical texts it has the sense of “orthodox Vedic doctrine” (Atharva Veda 11.3.26a, 15.1.8a; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 14.7.3.1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.24.1), comparable to the sense of Theravāda (“doctrine of the elders”). Here the Buddha, as so often, adapts the meaning to his own ends.
ud1.4:4.5	who have no pretensions about anything in the world.”	“Pretensions” renders _ussadā_. This line is found in the earlier Aṭṭhavagga ([snp4.3:4.4]() and note), from where I suspect it has been imported. Here it dangles as the last line of the only five-line stanza in the Udāna, following a line that is already grammatically complete (the demonstrative _so_ answers the relative _yo_ in the opening line). Perhaps it was added to downplay the importance of the term _brahmavāda_.

ud1.5:0.2	The Brahmin	NA
ud1.5:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud1.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud1.5:1.3	Now at that time a number of senior monks approached the Buddha—Venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahākappina, Mahācunda, Anuruddha, Revata, and Nanda.	A similar list of great disciples is found in the prelude to the Ānāpānassatisutta at [mn118:1.3](). The only difference is that there the final person is Ānanda rather than Nanda. It is tempting to follow the BJT and PTS in reading Ānanda here as well, but the purpose of this sutta is to extol all these monks as “brahmins”, which the sutta itself explains as meaning “with fetters ended”, namely arahants. But at this time, Ānanda was still a stream-enterer ([dn16:5.13.2]()), and would only attain arahantship after the Buddha’s passing away ([pli-tv-kd21:1.6.1]()). Nanda, on the other hand, was indeed an arahant ([ud3.2:14.3]()).
ud1.5:2.1	The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance,	NA
ud1.5:2.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud1.5:2.3	“These, mendicants, are brahmins coming!	NA
ud1.5:2.4	These are brahmins coming!”	NA
ud1.5:2.5	When he said this, a certain mendicant who was brahmin by birth asked the Buddha,	NA
ud1.5:2.6	“Sir, how do you define a brahmin? And what are the things that make one a brahmin?”	NA
ud1.5:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud1.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.	NA
ud1.6:1.4	Then after some time he recovered from that illness.	NA
ud1.6:1.5	It occurred to him,	NA
ud1.6:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?”	NA
ud1.6:2.1	Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa.	NA
ud1.6:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA

ud1.7:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down.	NA
ud1.7:1.4	Then Ajakalāpaka, wanting to make the Buddha feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, approached him, and while not far away yelled three times, “Grr! Arrgh!” Then he added,	NA
ud1.7:1.5	“Now that’s a goblin for you, ascetic!”	NA

ud1.8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud1.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud1.8:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA
ud1.8:1.4	His former wife heard	NA
ud1.8:1.5	that he had arrived,	NA
ud1.8:1.6	and went to the Jetavana, taking their boy.	NA
ud1.8:2.1	Now at that time Venerable Saṅgāmaji was sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
ud1.8:2.2	Then his former wife went up to him and said,	NA
ud1.8:2.3	“Ascetic, please raise this little boy.”	Read _naṁ_ throughout.
ud1.8:2.4	When she said this, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.	NA
ud1.8:3.1	For a second time she said,	NA
ud1.8:3.2	“Ascetic, please raise this little boy.”	NA
ud1.8:3.3	For a second time, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.	NA
ud1.8:4.1	For a third time she said,	NA
ud1.8:4.2	“Ascetic, please raise this little boy.”	NA
ud1.8:4.3	For a third time, Saṅgāmaji kept silent.	NA
ud1.8:5.1	Then she put down the boy in front of Saṅgāmaji, saying,	NA
ud1.8:5.2	“This is your child, ascetic. Please raise him.”	NA
ud1.8:6.1	But Saṅgāmaji neither looked at the boy nor spoke to him.	NA
ud1.8:6.2	Then his former wife went a little distance away. Looking back, she saw Saṅgāmaji ignoring the boy, and thought,	NA
ud1.8:6.3	“This ascetic doesn’t even want his child.”	_Atthiko_ is tricky to translate due to the vagueness of the base term. Ānandajoti has “need”, while Ṭhānissaro has “care about”. But it is usually used in the sense of “want”, as a synonym of _gavesī_, etc., or one who desires a kingdom.
ud1.8:6.4	She returned to pick up the boy, then left.	NA
ud1.8:6.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw how Saṅgāmaji’s former wife went back for the child.	For _vippakāraṁ_, Ānandajoti has “bad manners”, while Ṭhānissaro has “misbehaving”. Neither of these seems justified. PTS dictionary gives only commentarial citations for this word, but it also occurs at [pli-tv-pvr15:37.7](), where it is defined as changes in posture. It seems the Buddha merely observed that the former wife had changed her mind and gone back. Otherwise, the sutta passes no judgment on her behavior.
ud1.8:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud1.8:8.1	“When she came he was not glad,	NA
ud1.8:8.2	when she left he did not grieve.	NA

ud1.9:2.1	The Buddha saw them plunging in and out.	NA
ud1.9:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud1.9:4.1	“Purity doesn’t come from water,	NA
ud1.9:4.2	no matter how many people bathe there.	NA
ud1.9:4.3	One who has truth and principle,	NA
ud1.9:4.4	they are pure, they are brahmins.”	NA
ud1.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 1.10	NA
ud1.10:0.2	With Bāhiya	NA
ud1.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud1.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud1.10:1.3	Now at that time Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth was residing by Suppāraka on the ocean shore, where he was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud1.10:1.4	Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
ud1.10:1.5	“I am one of those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection.”	NA
ud1.10:2.1	Then a deity who was a former relative of Bāhiya, having sympathy and wanting what’s best for him, approached him and said:	NA
ud1.10:2.2	“Bāhiya, you’re not a perfected one, nor on the path to perfection.	NA
ud1.10:2.3	You don’t have the practice by which you might become a perfected one or one on the path to perfection.”	NA
ud1.10:3.1	“Then who exactly are those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection?”	NA
ud1.10:3.2	“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.	NA
ud1.10:3.3	There that Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
ud1.10:3.4	He is a perfected one and teaches the Dhamma for the sake of perfection.”	NA
ud1.10:4.1	Impelled by that deity, Bāhiya left Suppāraka right away.	NA
ud1.10:4.2	Sojourning no more than a single night in any place, he made his way to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery in the Jeta Grove at Sāvatthī.	NA
ud1.10:4.3	At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.	NA
ud1.10:4.4	Bāhiya approached them and said,	NA
ud1.10:4.5	“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?	NA
ud1.10:4.6	For I want to see him.”	NA
ud1.10:4.7	“He has entered an inhabited area for almsfood, Bāhiya.”	NA
ud1.10:5.1	Then Bāhiya rushed out of the Jeta Grove and entered Sāvatthī, where he saw the Buddha walking for alms. He was impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.	NA
ud1.10:5.2	Bāhiya went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,	NA
ud1.10:5.3	“Sir, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!	NA
ud1.10:5.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
ud1.10:5.5	The Buddha said this:	NA
ud1.10:5.6	“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”	NA
ud1.10:6.1	For a second time, Bāhiya said,	NA
ud1.10:6.2	“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.	NA
ud1.10:6.3	Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!	NA
ud1.10:6.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
ud1.10:6.5	For a second time, the Buddha said,	NA
ud1.10:6.6	“It’s not the time, Bāhiya, so long as I have entered an inhabited area for almsfood.”	NA
ud1.10:7.1	For a third time, Bāhiya said,	NA
ud1.10:7.2	“But you never know, sir, when life is at risk, either the Buddha’s or my own.	NA
ud1.10:7.3	Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach me the Dhamma!	NA
ud1.10:7.4	That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”	NA
ud1.10:8.1	“In that case, Bāhiya, you should train like this:	NA
ud1.10:8.2	‘In the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard will be merely the heard; in the thought will be merely the thought; in the known will be merely the known.’	NA
ud1.10:8.3	That’s how you should train.	NA
ud1.10:8.4	When you have trained in this way,	NA
ud1.10:8.5	you won’t be ‘by that’.	NA
ud1.10:8.6	When you’re not ‘by that’,	NA
ud1.10:8.7	you won’t be ‘in that’.	NA
ud1.10:8.8	When you’re not ‘in that’,	NA
ud1.10:8.9	you won’t be in this world or the world beyond or between the two.	NA
ud1.10:8.10	Just this is the end of suffering.”	NA
ud1.10:9.1	Then, due to this brief Dhamma teaching of the Buddha, Bāhiya’s mind was right away freed from defilements by not grasping.	NA
ud1.10:10.1	And when the Buddha had given Bāhiya this brief advice he left.	NA
ud1.10:10.2	But soon after the Buddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at Bāhiya and took his life.	NA
ud1.10:11.1	Then the Buddha wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he departed the city together with several mendicants and saw that Bāhiya had passed away.	NA
ud1.10:11.2	He said to the monks,	NA
ud1.10:11.3	“Mendicants, pick up Bāhiya’s corpse. Having lifted it onto a cot and carried it, cremate it and build a monument.	NA
ud1.10:11.4	Mendicants, one of your spiritual companions has passed away.”	NA
ud1.10:12.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They did as the Buddha asked, then returned to the Buddha	NA
ud1.10:12.2	and said,	NA
ud1.10:12.3	“Sir, Bāhiya’s corpse has been cremated and a monument built for him.	NA
ud1.10:12.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
ud1.10:12.5	“Mendicants, Bāhiya was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA
ud1.10:12.6	Bāhiya of the Bark Cloth has become fully quenched.”	NA
ud1.10:13.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud1.10:14.1	“Where water and earth,	Compare similar lines at [sn1.27:2.1](); and a similar idea at [ud8.1:3.1]().
ud1.10:14.2	fire and air do not remain—	NA
ud1.10:14.3	there no star does shine,	Compare Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.2.15: “There the sun shines not, nor the moon and stars”.
ud1.10:14.4	nor does the sun shed its light;	NA
ud1.10:14.5	there the moon glows not,	NA
ud1.10:14.6	yet no darkness is found.	NA
ud1.10:15.1	And when a sage, a brahmin, finds understanding	NA
ud1.10:15.2	through their own sagacity,	NA
ud1.10:15.3	then from forms and formless,	NA
ud1.10:15.4	from pleasure and pain they are released.”	NA
ud1.10:16.1	This too is a heartfelt saying that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.	This tag is unique to the Udāna, and seems to be a relic of an earlier oral organization. It is virtually identical to the tag concluding each discourse of the Itivuttaka, except there we find _attha_ instead of _udāna_.
ud2.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 2.1	NA
ud2.1:0.2	With Mucalinda	NA
ud2.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud2.1:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the Mucalinda tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
ud2.1:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.	NA
ud2.1:2.1	Just then a great storm blew up out of season, bringing seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds.	NA
ud2.1:2.2	Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode, encircled the Buddha’s body with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking,	NA
ud2.1:2.3	“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be bothered by flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, or reptiles.”	NA
ud2.1:3.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion.	NA
ud2.1:3.2	When he knew the heavens were clear and cloudless, Mucalinda unwrapped his coils from the Buddha’s body. Hiding his own form, he manifested in the form of a brahmin youth. He stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms.	NA
ud2.1:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.1:5.1	“Seclusion is happiness for the contented	NA
ud2.1:5.2	who see the teaching they have learned.	NA
ud2.1:5.3	Kindness for the world is happiness	NA
ud2.1:5.4	for one who’d not harm a living creature.	NA
ud2.1:6.1	Dispassion for the world is happiness	NA
ud2.1:6.2	for one who has gone beyond sensual pleasures.	NA

ud2.2:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud2.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud2.2:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:	NA
ud2.2:1.4	“Which of these two kings has greater wealth, riches, treasury, dominion, vehicles, forces, might, and power: King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?”	NA
ud2.2:1.5	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	NA
ud2.2:2.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
ud2.2:2.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud2.2:2.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
ud2.2:3.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said,	NA
ud2.2:4.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things.	NA
ud2.2:4.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	NA
ud2.2:4.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”	NA
ud2.2:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.2:6.1	“Neither the pleasures of the senses,	NA
ud2.2:6.2	nor even divine happiness,	NA
ud2.2:6.3	is worth even a sixteenth part	NA

ud2.3:1.4	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
ud2.3:1.5	He saw the boys hitting the snake.	NA
ud2.3:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud2.3:3.2	so if you harm them with a stick	NA
ud2.3:3.3	in search of your own happiness,	NA

ud2.4:1.6	Then those wanderers who followed other religions, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the mendicants in the village and the wilderness.	NA
ud2.4:2.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA

ud2.5:1.4	Having concluded his business in Sāvatthī he went to see the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
ud2.5:1.5	The Buddha said this to him:	NA

ud2.5:2.1	“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities.”	NA
ud2.5:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.5:4.1	“One who has nothing is happy indeed,	NA
ud2.5:4.2	a learned person who has appraised the teaching.	NA
ud2.5:4.3	See how troubled are those with attachments,	NA

ud2.6:1.3	Now at that time a certain wanderer had a young brahmin wife who was pregnant and about to give birth.	NA
ud2.6:1.4	She said to him,	NA
ud2.6:1.5	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”	NA
ud2.6:2.1	The wanderer said,	NA
ud2.6:2.2	“But where, my dear, can I get oil?”	NA
ud2.6:2.3	For a second time, she said,	NA

ud2.6:2.7	For a third time, she said,	NA
ud2.6:2.8	“Go, brahmin, bring oil for my delivery.”	NA
ud2.6:3.1	Now at that time ghee and oil were being given away to any ascetic or brahmin at the storehouse of King Pasenadi of Kosala. But it was only to drink there, not to take away.	NA
ud2.6:4.1	Knowing this, the wanderer thought,	NA
ud2.6:4.3	“Why don’t I go to the king’s storehouse, drink as much oil as I can, then come home and throw it up so it can be used for the delivery?”	NA
ud2.6:5.1	Then he did just that. But when he got home he was unable to either bring it up or pass it out.	NA
ud2.6:5.2	He rolled to and fro, suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings.	NA

ud2.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kuṇḍiyā in the Kuṇḍadhāna Grove.	NA
ud2.8:1.3	Now at that time Suppavāsā the Koliyan had been pregnant for seven years, and in obstructed labor for seven days.	_Mūḷha_ here has the sense of “gone astray” in reference to obstructed labor that prevents birth; see [mn86:14.2]().
ud2.8:1.4	While suffering painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings, three thoughts helped her endure:	NA
ud2.8:1.5	“Oh! The Blessed One is indeed a fully awakened Buddha, who teaches the Dhamma for giving up suffering such as this.	NA
ud2.8:1.6	Oh! The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is indeed practicing well, who practice for giving up suffering such as this.	NA
ud2.8:1.7	Oh! Extinguishment is so very blissful, where such suffering as this is not found.”	NA
ud2.8:2.1	Then Suppavāsā addressed her husband,	NA
ud2.8:2.2	“Please, master, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.	NA

ud2.8:3.1	“Excellent idea,” he replied. He went to the Buddha and told him of his wife’s struggles. The Buddha said:	NA
ud2.8:4.1	“May Suppavāsā the Koliyan be happy and healthy! May she give birth to a healthy child!”	NA
ud2.8:4.2	As soon as he spoke, Suppavāsā, happy and healthy, gave birth to a healthy child.	NA
ud2.8:5.1	Saying “Yes, sir,” the Koliyan gentleman approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he returned to his own house.	NA
ud2.8:5.2	He saw that his wife, happy and healthy, had given birth to a healthy child,	NA
ud2.8:5.3	and thought,	NA
ud2.8:5.4	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! For as soon as he spoke, Suppavāsā, happy and healthy, gave birth to a healthy child.”	NA
ud2.8:5.5	He became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.	NA

ud2.8:6.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan, who was pregnant for seven years, and in obstructed labor for seven days,	NA

ud2.8:6.8	Sir, might the Buddha please accept seven meals from Suppavāsā.’”	NA
ud2.8:7.1	“Excellent idea,” he replied. He went to the Buddha, told him the good news, and conveyed his wife’s invitation.	NA
ud2.8:9.1	Now at that time a certain lay follower had already invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.	NA
ud2.8:9.2	That lay follower was Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter.	NA

ud2.8:9.5	‘Suppavāsā the Koliyan, who was pregnant for seven years, and in obstructed labor for seven days,	NA

ud2.8:9.9	He is your supporter.”	NA
ud2.8:10.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. He went to that lay follower and conveyed the Buddha’s request.	NA
ud2.8:11.1	“If, sir, Master Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me three things—	NA
ud2.8:11.2	wealth, life, and faith—	NA
ud2.8:11.3	then let Suppavāsā make seven meals, afterwards I shall make mine.”	NA
ud2.8:11.4	“I can guarantee you two things—	NA
ud2.8:11.5	wealth and life.	NA
ud2.8:11.6	But as for faith, you alone are the guarantor.”	NA
ud2.8:12.1	“If, sir Master Mahāmoggallāna can guarantee me two things—	NA
ud2.8:12.2	wealth and life—	NA
ud2.8:12.3	then let Suppavāsā make seven meals, afterwards I shall make mine.”	NA
ud2.8:13.1	Having persuaded that lay follower, Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha and said,	NA
ud2.8:13.2	“I’ve persuaded the lay follower.	NA
ud2.8:13.3	Let Suppavāsā make seven meals, afterwards he shall make his.”	NA
ud2.8:14.1	For seven days Suppavāsā served and satisfied the Buddha with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
ud2.8:14.2	And she made her little boy bow to the Buddha and the mendicant Sangha.	NA
ud2.8:15.1	Then Sāriputta said to the boy,	NA
ud2.8:15.2	“I hope you’re keeping well, little boy; I hope you’re all right. I hope that you are not in pain.”	NA
ud2.8:15.3	“How could I be keeping well? How could I be getting by?	NA
ud2.8:15.4	For seven years I lived in a pot of blood.”	_Lohitakumbhiya_ is probably a play on the common phrase _lohakumbhiya_, “copper pot”, which is commonly used in descriptions of hell. The boy, it seems, had an unusually rapid linguistic development.
ud2.8:16.1	Then Suppavāsā, thinking,	NA
ud2.8:16.2	“My child is conversing with the General of the Dhamma!” was uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness.	NA
ud2.8:16.3	Knowing this, the Buddha said to her,	NA
ud2.8:16.4	“Would you like to have another child like this?”	NA
ud2.8:16.5	“Sir, I would like to have seven more children like this!”	NA
ud2.8:17.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.8:18.1	“Pain in the guise of pleasure,	NA
ud2.8:18.2	the disliked in the guise of the liked,	NA
ud2.8:18.3	suffering in the guise of happiness,	NA
ud2.8:18.4	overpower the negligent.”	NA

ud2.9:0.2	With Visākhā	NA
ud2.9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud2.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
ud2.9:1.3	Now at that time Visākhā was caught up in some business with King Pasenadi.	NA
ud2.9:1.4	But the king’s settlement did not meet her expectations.	NA
ud2.9:2.1	Then, in the middle of the day, she went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.	NA
ud2.9:2.2	The Buddha said to her:	NA
ud2.9:2.3	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”	NA
ud2.9:2.4	“Sir, I am caught up in some business with King Pasenadi.	NA
ud2.9:2.5	But the king’s settlement did not meet my expectations.”	NA
ud2.9:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.9:4.1	“All under another’s control is suffering,	NA
ud2.9:4.2	all under one’s own authority is pleasing;	NA
ud2.9:4.3	what’s shared is stressful for both parties,	NA
ud2.9:4.4	for yokes are hard to escape.”	NA
ud2.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 2.10	NA
ud2.10:0.2	With Bhaddiya	NA
ud2.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud2.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Anupiya in a mango grove.	NA
ud2.10:1.3	Now at that time, Venerable Bhaddiya son of Kāḷīgodhā, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.10:1.4	“Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!”	NA
ud2.10:2.1	Several mendicants heard him	NA
ud2.10:2.3	and thought,	NA
ud2.10:2.4	“Without a doubt, Venerable Bhaddiya leads the spiritual life dissatisfied.	NA
ud2.10:2.5	It’s when recalling the pleasures of royalty he formerly enjoyed as a lay person that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently expresses this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.10:2.6	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”	NA
ud2.10:3.1	Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	NA
ud2.10:4.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
ud2.10:4.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Bhaddiya that	NA
ud2.10:4.3	the teacher summons him.”	NA
ud2.10:5.1	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Bhaddiya and said to him,	NA
ud2.10:5.2	“Reverend Bhaddiya, the teacher summons you.”	NA
ud2.10:5.3	“Yes, reverend,” Bhaddiya replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
ud2.10:6.1	“Is it really true, Bhaddiya, that even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently express this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.10:6.2	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’?”	NA
ud2.10:6.3	“Yes, sir.”	NA
ud2.10:7.1	“But why do you say this?”	NA
ud2.10:7.3	“Formerly, as a lay person ruling the land, my guard was well organized within and without the royal compound, within and without the city, and within and without the country.	NA
ud2.10:7.4	But although I was guarded and defended in this way, I remained fearful, scared, suspicious, and nervous.	NA
ud2.10:7.5	But these days, even when alone in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m not fearful, scared, suspicious, or nervous. I live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, my heart free as a wild deer.	NA
ud2.10:7.6	It is for this reason that, even in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I frequently expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.10:7.7	‘Oh, what bliss! Oh, what bliss!’”	NA
ud2.10:8.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud2.10:9.1	“They who hide no anger within,	NA
ud2.10:9.2	gone beyond any kind of existence;	NA
ud2.10:9.3	happy, free from fear and sorrow—	NA

ud3.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.1	NA
ud3.1:0.2	Born of the Fruits of deeds	NA
ud3.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.1:1.3	Now, at that time a certain mendicant was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight. As a result of past deeds, he suffered painful, sharp, severe, and acute feelings, which he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and awareness.	NA
ud3.1:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating and enduring that pain.	NA
ud3.1:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.1:4.1	“A mendicant who has left all deeds behind,	NA
ud3.1:4.2	shaking off the dust of past deeds,	NA
ud3.1:4.3	unselfish, steady, unaffected,	NA
ud3.1:4.4	has no need to complain.”	NA
ud3.2:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.2	NA
ud3.2:0.2	With Nanda	NA
ud3.2:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.2:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Nanda, the Buddha’s brother and maternal cousin, informed several mendicants:	NA
ud3.2:1.4	“I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied.	NA
ud3.2:1.5	I am unable to keep up the spiritual life. I shall resign the training and return to a lesser life.”	NA
ud3.2:2.1	Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	NA
ud3.2:3.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
ud3.2:3.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Nanda that	NA
ud3.2:3.3	the teacher summons him.”	NA
ud3.2:3.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Nanda and said to him,	NA
ud3.2:3.5	“Reverend Nanda, the teacher summons you.”	NA
ud3.2:4.1	“Yes, reverend,” Nanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
ud3.2:5.1	“Is it really true, Nanda, that you informed several mendicants that	NA
ud3.2:5.2	you are unable to keep up the spiritual life; that you shall resign the training and return to a lesser life?”	NA
ud3.2:5.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	NA
ud3.2:6.1	“But why are you so dissatisfied with the spiritual life?”	NA
ud3.2:6.2	“As I left my house, sir, the finest lady of the Sakyan land, her hair half-combed, glanced at me and said,	NA
ud3.2:6.3	‘Hurry back, master.’	NA
ud3.2:6.4	Recalling that, I am dissatisfied and shall resign the training.”	NA
ud3.2:7.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
ud3.2:8.1	Now at that time five hundred dove-footed nymphs had come to attend to Sakka, the lord of gods.	The image of the “dove-footed” nymphs is, so far as I know, unique. Doves have bright pink feet, evoking the rouged feet often mentioned as a sign of beauty. But doves in Vedic mythology are emissaries of  Nirṛti, the malign goddess of dissolution. The footprint of a dove in the fireplace is an omen of death (Rig Veda 10.165.4,  Āpastamba Gṛhyasūtra 8.23.9). Perhaps these delightful nymphs are the secret emissaries of Dissolution, their feet betraying the horrifying reality beneath the beguiling surface.
ud3.2:8.2	Then the Buddha said to Nanda,	NA
ud3.2:8.3	“Nanda, do you see these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?”	NA
ud3.2:8.4	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	NA
ud3.2:9.1	“What do you think, Nanda? Who is more attractive, good-looking, and lovely—the finest lady of the Sakyan land, or these five hundred dove-footed nymphs?”	NA
ud3.2:9.2	“Compared to these five hundred dove-footed nymphs, the finest lady of the Sakyan land is like a deformed monkey with its ears and nose cut off.	NA
ud3.2:9.3	She doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, she’s not worth a fraction.	NA
ud3.2:9.4	These five hundred dove-footed nymphs are far more attractive, good-looking, and lovely.”	NA
ud3.2:10.1	“Rejoice, Nanda, rejoice!	NA
ud3.2:10.2	I guarantee you five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	NA
ud3.2:10.3	“If, sir, you guarantee me five hundred dove-footed nymphs, I shall happily lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.”	NA
ud3.2:11.1	Then the Buddha took Nanda by the arm and, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared at Jeta’s Grove.	NA
ud3.2:12.1	The mendicants heard,	NA
ud3.2:12.2	“It seems Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.	NA
ud3.2:12.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	NA
ud3.2:13.1	Monks who were his friends accused him of being a hireling and a lackey,	NA
ud3.2:13.2	“It seems Nanda is a hireling, it seems he is a lackey: he leads the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.	NA
ud3.2:13.3	And it seems that the Buddha guaranteed him five hundred dove-footed nymphs.”	NA
ud3.2:14.1	Then Nanda—embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted at being called a hireling and a lackey—living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA
ud3.2:14.2	He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.”	NA
ud3.2:14.3	Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected.	NA
ud3.2:15.1	Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:	NA
ud3.2:15.2	“Sir, Venerable Nanda—who is both the Buddha’s half-brother and maternal cousin—has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”	NA
ud3.2:15.3	And the knowledge also came to the Buddha:	NA
ud3.2:15.4	“Nanda has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.”	NA
ud3.2:16.1	Then, when the night had passed, Nanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud3.2:16.2	“Worthy sir, you guaranteed me five hundred dove-footed nymphs. I release you from that promise.”	NA
ud3.2:16.3	“Nanda, I comprehended your mind and knew that	NA
ud3.2:16.4	you had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom.	NA
ud3.2:16.5	And deities also told me about this.	NA
ud3.2:16.7	As soon as your mind was freed from defilements by not grasping, I was released from that promise.”	NA
ud3.2:17.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.2:18.1	“The mendicant who has crossed over the bog,	NA
ud3.2:18.2	who has crushed the thorn of sensuality,	NA
ud3.2:18.3	who has reached the end of delusion,	NA
ud3.2:18.4	trembles not at pleasure and pain.”	NA
ud3.3:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.3	NA
ud3.3:0.2	With Yasoja	NA
ud3.3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.3:1.3	Now at that time five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA
ud3.3:1.4	At that, those visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.	The narrative employs a unique scheme in introducing the repetitions: _tedha_, _tete_, _teme_.
ud3.3:2.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud3.3:2.2	“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	NA
ud3.3:2.3	“Sir, those five hundred mendicants headed by Yasoja have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA
ud3.3:2.4	It’s those visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.”	NA
ud3.3:2.5	“Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that	NA
ud3.3:2.6	the teacher summons them.”	NA
ud3.3:3.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said,	NA
ud3.3:3.2	“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”	NA
ud3.3:3.3	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,	NA
ud3.3:4.1	“Mendicants, what’s with that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”	NA
ud3.3:4.2	When he said this, Venerable Yasoja said to the Buddha,	NA
ud3.3:4.3	“Sir, these five hundred mendicants have arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.	NA
ud3.3:4.4	It’s these visiting mendicants who, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.”	NA
ud3.3:4.5	“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”	NA
ud3.3:5.1	“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.	NA
ud3.3:5.2	Traveling stage by stage in the land of the Vajjis, they arrived at the Vaggumudā River. They built leaf huts near the riverbank and there they entered the rainy season.	NA
ud3.3:6.1	Then Venerable Yasoja, having entered the rainy season, addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud3.3:6.2	“Out of sympathy, reverends, the Buddha dismissed us, wanting what’s best for us.	NA
ud3.3:6.3	Come, let us live in such a way that the Buddha would be pleased with us.”	NA
ud3.3:6.4	“Yes, reverend,” they replied.	NA
ud3.3:6.5	Then those mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, all realized the three knowledges in that same rainy season.	NA
ud3.3:7.1	When the Buddha had stayed in Sāvatthī as long as he pleased, he set out for Vesālī.	NA
ud3.3:7.2	Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī,	NA
ud3.3:7.3	where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
ud3.3:8.1	Then, having applied his mind to comprehending the minds of the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud3.3:8.2	“A light, it appears to me, has arisen in this quarter, Ānanda; a brightness has arisen.	NA
ud3.3:8.3	I’m not put off at the thought of going to where the mendicants are staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.	Here the Buddha invents the concept of “faint praise”.
ud3.3:8.4	Send a message to those mendicants:	NA
ud3.3:8.5	‘Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.’”	NA
ud3.3:9.1	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to one of the mendicants and said,	NA
ud3.3:9.2	“Please, Reverend, go to the mendicants staying on the bank of the river Vaggumudā and say to them,	NA
ud3.3:9.3	‘Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.’”	NA
ud3.3:10.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied that mendicant.	NA
ud3.3:10.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, and reappeared in front of those mendicants on the bank of the river Vaggumudā.	NA
ud3.3:10.3	Then he said to those mendicants,	NA
ud3.3:10.4	“Venerables, the teacher summons you. He wants to see you.”	NA
ud3.3:11.1	“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants. They set their lodgings in order and took their bowls and robes.	NA
ud3.3:11.2	Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and reappeared in the presence of the Buddha in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
ud3.3:11.3	But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in imperturbable meditation.	NA
ud3.3:11.4	Then those mendicants thought,	NA
ud3.3:11.5	“What kind of meditation is the Buddha practicing right now?”	NA
ud3.3:11.6	They thought,	NA
ud3.3:11.7	“He is practicing the imperturbable meditation.”	NA
ud3.3:11.8	They all sat in imperturbable meditation.	NA
ud3.3:12.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud3.3:12.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	NA
ud3.3:12.3	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	NA
ud3.3:12.4	But the Buddha kept silent.	NA
ud3.3:13.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud3.3:13.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the second watch of the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	NA
ud3.3:13.5	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	NA
ud3.3:13.6	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.	NA
ud3.3:14.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud3.3:14.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night; dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night, and the visiting mendicants have been sitting long.	NA
ud3.3:14.7	Sir, please greet the visiting mendicants.”	NA
ud3.3:15.1	Then the Buddha emerged from that immersion and addressed Ānanda,	NA
ud3.3:15.2	“If you’d known, Ānanda, you wouldn’t have said so much.	Ānandajoti has “about them” for _te_ here, but in parallel phrases we find _no_, so this must be the second person singular pronoun.
ud3.3:15.3	Both I and these five hundred mendicants have been sitting in imperturbable meditation.”	NA
ud3.3:16.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.3:17.1	“A mendicant who has beaten <j>the thorn of sensuality—	NA
ud3.3:17.2	and abuse, killing, and caging—	NA
ud3.3:17.3	steady as a mountain, imperturbable,	NA
ud3.3:17.4	trembles not at pleasure and pain.”	NA
ud3.4:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.4	NA
ud3.4:0.2	With Sāriputta	NA
ud3.4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.4:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in his presence.	NA
ud3.4:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud3.4:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.4:3.1	“As a rocky mountain	NA
ud3.4:3.2	is unwavering and well grounded,	NA
ud3.4:3.3	so when delusion ends,	NA
ud3.4:3.4	a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.”	NA
ud3.5:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.5	NA
ud3.5:0.2	With Mahāmoggallāna	NA
ud3.5:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.5:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight and mindfulness of the body well-established in himself.	NA
ud3.5:1.4	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud3.5:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.5:3.1	“With mindfulness of the body established,	NA
ud3.5:3.2	restrained in the six fields of contact,	NA
ud3.5:3.3	a mendicant always immersed in samādhi	NA
ud3.5:3.4	would know extinguishment in themselves.”	NA
ud3.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 3.6	NA
ud3.6:0.2	With Pilindavaccha	NA
ud3.6:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud3.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Pilindavaccha addressed the mendicants as “lowlifes”.	NA
ud3.6:1.4	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud3.6:1.5	“Sir, Venerable Pilindavaccha addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”	NA
ud3.6:2.1	So the Buddha addressed one of the monks,	NA
ud3.6:2.2	“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Pilindavaccha that	NA
ud3.6:2.3	the Teacher summons him.”	NA
ud3.6:2.4	“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Pilindavaccha and said to him,	NA
ud3.6:2.5	“Reverend Pilindavaccha, the teacher summons you.”	NA
ud3.6:3.1	“Yes, reverend,” Pilindavaccha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:	NA
ud3.6:3.2	“Is it really true, Vaccha, that you addressed the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’?”	NA
ud3.6:3.3	“Yes, sir,” he replied.	NA
ud3.6:4.1	Then, having applied his mind to Pilindavaccha’s past lives, the Buddha said to the mendicants,	NA
ud3.6:4.2	“Mendicants, don’t complain about the mendicant Vaccha.	NA
ud3.6:4.3	He doesn’t address the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’ out of hate.	NA
ud3.6:4.4	For five hundred lives without interruption he was reborn in a brahmin family.	NA
ud3.6:4.5	For a long time, he has addressed people as ‘lowlife’.	NA
ud3.6:4.6	That’s why he addresses the mendicants as ‘lowlifes’.”	NA
ud3.6:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.6:6.1	“In whom dwells no deceit or conceit,	NA
ud3.6:6.2	rid of greed, unselfish, with no need for hope,	NA
ud3.6:6.3	with anger eliminated, quenched:	NA
ud3.6:6.4	they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant.”	NA

ud3.7:0.2	Sakka’s Heartfelt Saying	NA
ud3.7:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud3.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave. Having entered a certain state of immersion, he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving.	NA
ud3.7:1.4	When seven days had passed, Mahākassapa emerged from that state of immersion.	NA
ud3.7:1.5	It occurred to him,	NA
ud3.7:1.6	“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?”	NA
ud3.7:2.1	Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa.	NA
ud3.7:2.2	But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
ud3.7:2.3	Now at that time Sakka, lord of gods, wished to give alms to Mahākassapa.	NA
ud3.7:3.2	Having manifested in the appearance of a weaver, he worked the loom while the titan maiden Sujā fed the shuttle.	Sujā is Sakka’s wife ([sn11.12:6.1]()).
ud3.7:3.3	Then, as Mahākassapa wandered indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Sakka’s house.	NA
ud3.7:3.4	Seeing Mahākassapa coming off in the distance,	NA
ud3.7:3.5	Sakka came out of his house, greeted him, and took the bowl from his hand. He re-entered the house and filled the bowl with rice from the pot.	NA
ud3.7:3.6	That almsfood had many tasty soups and sauces.	I’m not sure if _anekarasabyañjano_ is correct, although the word does occur at [Pv 13:15.4](https://suttacentral.net/pv13/pli/ms#15.4) and [Pv 27:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/pv27/pli/ms#12.4). The commentary, while not definitive, suggests _anekasūpabyañjano_ (_anekehi sūpehi ceva byañjanehi ca_), which would be more idiomatic. However it is not attested.
ud3.7:3.7	Then it occurred to Mahākassapa,	NA
ud3.7:3.8	“Now, what being is this who has such psychic power?”	NA
ud3.7:3.9	It occurred to him,	NA
ud3.7:3.10	“This is Sakka, lord of gods.”	NA
ud3.7:3.11	Knowing this, he said to Sakka,	NA
ud3.7:3.12	“This is your doing, Kosiya;	NA
ud3.7:3.13	don’t do such a thing again.”	NA
ud3.7:3.14	“But Honorable Kassapa, we too need merit!	NA
ud3.7:3.15	We too ought to make merit.”	NA
ud3.7:4.1	Then Sakka bowed and respectfully circled Mahākassapa, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in midair, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times:	NA
ud3.7:4.2	“Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!	NA
ud3.7:4.3	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!	NA
ud3.7:4.4	Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!”	NA
ud3.7:4.5	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard Sakka express this heartfelt sentiment while sitting in the sky.	NA
ud3.7:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.7:6.1	“A mendicant who relies on alms,	NA
ud3.7:6.2	self-supported, providing for no other;	NA
ud3.7:6.3	the unaffected one is envied by even the gods,	NA
ud3.7:6.4	calm and ever mindful.”	NA

ud3.8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud3.8:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this discussion came up among them:	NA
ud3.8:2.1	“Reverends, when a mendicant who eats only almsfood is wandering for alms, from time to time they get to see pleasing sights, hear pleasing sounds, smell pleasing smells, taste pleasing tastes, and encounter pleasing touches.	NA
ud3.8:2.2	They wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.	NA
ud3.8:2.3	Come, we too should eat only almsfood.	NA
ud3.8:2.4	From time to time we too will get to see pleasing sights, hear pleasing sounds, smell pleasing smells, taste pleasing tastes, and encounter pleasing touches.	NA
ud3.8:2.5	We too shall wander for alms being honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed.”	NA
ud3.8:2.6	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	NA
ud3.8:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion by the kareri tree, where he sat on the seat spread out	NA
ud3.8:3.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud3.8:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
ud3.8:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,	NA
ud3.8:6.1	“Mendicants, it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness to talk about such things.	NA
ud3.8:6.2	When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:	NA
ud3.8:6.3	discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.”	NA
ud3.8:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud3.8:8.2	self-supported, providing for no other;	NA
ud3.8:8.3	the unaffected one is envied by even the gods,	NA

ud3.9:1.3	Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them:	NA
ud3.9:1.4	“Who knows a craft?	NA
ud3.9:1.5	Who is studying which craft?	NA
ud3.9:1.6	Which is the best craft?”	NA
ud3.9:2.1	In answer, some said that	NA

ud3.9:2.3	Others said that the best craft is	NA
ud3.9:2.4	horse-craft,	NA

ud3.9:2.25	At that point the conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.	NA
ud3.9:3.1	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out,	NA
ud3.9:3.2	and addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud3.9:3.3	“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”	NA
ud3.9:4.1	So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said,	NA

ud3.9:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.9:8.1	“Living without a craft, light, wanting what is best,	NA
ud3.9:8.2	with senses controlled, everywhere free;	NA
ud3.9:8.3	a migrant with no shelter, unselfish, <j>with no need for hope,	NA

ud3.10:0.2	The World	NA
ud3.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud3.10:1.2	At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying in Uruvelā at the root of the tree of awakening on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.	NA
ud3.10:1.3	There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.	NA
ud3.10:2.1	When seven days had passed, the Buddha emerged from that state of immersion and surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.	NA
ud3.10:2.2	He saw sentient beings tormented with many torments, and burning with many fevers	NA
ud3.10:2.3	born of greed, hate, and delusion.	NA
ud3.10:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud3.10:4.1	“This world, born in torment,	NA
ud3.10:4.2	overcome by contact, speaks of disease as the self.	NA
ud3.10:4.3	For whatever it thinks it is,	NA

ud3.10:5.6	in order to give up continued existence.	NA
ud3.10:6.1	Of the ascetics and brahmins who say that through continued existence one is freed from continued existence, none are themselves freed from continued existence, I say.	NA

ud3.10:7.1	For this suffering originates dependent on all attachment. With the ending of all grasping there is no origination of suffering.	Thai editions read _sabbupadhiṁ hi_, which is supported by the Udānavarga.

ud3.10:8.1	One who sees truly like this,	NA

ud4.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 4.1	NA
ud4.1:0.2	With Meghiya	NA
ud4.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud4.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain.	NA
ud4.1:1.3	Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant.	NA
ud4.1:1.4	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud4.1:1.5	“Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.”	NA
ud4.1:1.6	“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	NA
ud4.1:2.1	Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms.	NA
ud4.1:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river.	NA
ud4.1:2.3	As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove.	NA
ud4.1:2.4	When he saw this he thought,	NA
ud4.1:2.5	“Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.	NA
ud4.1:2.6	If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.”	NA
ud4.1:3.1	Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding,	NA
ud4.1:4.8	“If the Buddha allows me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	NA
ud4.1:5.1	When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,	NA
ud4.1:5.2	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	NA
ud4.1:6.1	For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	NA
ud4.1:6.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	NA
ud4.1:6.3	But I have.	NA
ud4.1:6.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	NA
ud4.1:6.5	For a second time the Buddha said,	NA
ud4.1:6.6	“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.”	NA
ud4.1:7.1	For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha,	NA
ud4.1:7.2	“Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.	NA
ud4.1:7.3	But I have.	NA
ud4.1:7.4	If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.”	NA
ud4.1:7.5	“Meghiya, since you speak of meditation, what can I say?	NA
ud4.1:7.6	Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.”	NA
ud4.1:8.1	Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.	NA
ud4.1:8.2	But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely,	NA
ud4.1:8.3	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.	NA
ud4.1:9.1	Then he thought,	NA
ud4.1:9.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing!	NA
ud4.1:9.3	I’ve gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness out of faith,	NA
ud4.1:9.4	but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts:	NA
ud4.1:9.5	sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.”	NA
ud4.1:10.1	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Meghiya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha what had happened.	NA
ud4.1:11.1	“Meghiya, when the heart’s release is not ripe, five things help it ripen.	NA
ud4.1:11.2	What five?	NA
ud4.1:12.1	Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates.	NA
ud4.1:12.2	This is the first thing …	NA
ud4.1:13.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.	NA
ud4.1:13.2	This is the second thing …	NA
ud4.1:14.1	Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom.’	NA
ud4.1:14.2	This is the third thing …	NA
ud4.1:15.1	Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.	NA
ud4.1:15.2	This is the fourth thing …	NA
ud4.1:16.1	Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.	NA
ud4.1:16.2	This is the fifth thing that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, helps it ripen.	NA
ud4.1:16.3	These are the five things that, when the heart’s release is not ripe, help it ripen.	NA
ud4.1:17.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be ethical …	NA
ud4.1:18.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart …	NA
ud4.1:19.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be energetic …	NA
ud4.1:20.1	A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be wise …	NA
ud4.1:21.1	But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things.	NA
ud4.1:21.2	They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’.	NA
ud4.1:21.3	When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized.	NA
ud4.1:21.4	Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.”	NA
ud4.1:22.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.1:23.1	“Lesser thoughts and subtle thoughts	NA
ud4.1:23.2	arise, springing up in the mind.	Following variant _anuggatā_. Udānavarga here has _samudgatāṁ_ (“arisen”), which makes for an easier reading.
ud4.1:23.3	Not understanding these thoughts,	NA
ud4.1:23.4	one with mind astray runs all over the place.	NA
ud4.1:24.1	Having understood these thoughts	NA
ud4.1:24.2	that arise, springing up in the mind,	NA
ud4.1:24.3	an awakened one—keen, restrained, and mindful—	NA
ud4.1:24.4	has given them up without remainder.”	NA

ud4.2:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud4.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.	NA
ud4.2:1.3	Now at that time several mendicants were staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.	NA
ud4.2:2.1	The Buddha saw those mendicants staying nearby.	NA
ud4.2:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.2:4.1	“Unguarded in body,	NA
ud4.2:4.2	ruined by wrong view,	The variant _micchādiṭṭhigatena_ is the more obvious reading. However, _micchādiṭṭhihatā_ appears at [an4.49]() without variants. Commentary accepts _hata_ in both places. Here it glosses _sassatādimicchābhinivesadūsitena_.
ud4.2:4.3	overcome with dullness and drowsiness,	NA
ud4.2:4.4	you fall under Māra’s sway.	NA

ud4.2:5.3	and right view at the fore.	NA
ud4.2:5.4	Having understood rise and fall,	NA
ud4.2:5.5	a mendicant who has overcome <j>dullness and drowsiness	NA
ud4.2:5.6	would cast off all bad destinies.”	NA

ud4.3:0.2	The Cowherd	NA
ud4.3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud4.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
ud4.3:1.3	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out.	NA
ud4.3:2.1	Then a certain cowherd went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
ud4.3:2.2	The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.	NA
ud4.3:3.1	Then the cowherd said to the Buddha,	NA
ud4.3:3.2	“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”	NA
ud4.3:3.3	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
ud4.3:3.4	The cowherd got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.	NA
ud4.3:4.1	And when the night had passed the cowherd had plenty of thick milk-rice prepared in his own home, with fresh ghee. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
ud4.3:4.2	“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”	NA
ud4.3:5.1	The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that cowherd, where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall.	NA
ud4.3:5.2	Then the cowherd served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a thick milk-rice and fresh ghee.	NA
ud4.3:5.3	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, the cowherd took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
ud4.3:5.4	The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up and left.	NA
ud4.3:5.5	But soon after the Buddha had left, the cowherd was killed by a certain man in the gap between village borders.	NA
ud4.3:6.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.	NA
ud4.3:7.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.3:8.1	“A wrongly directed mind	NA
ud4.3:8.2	would do you more harm	NA
ud4.3:8.3	than a hater to the hated,	NA
ud4.3:8.4	or an enemy to their foe.”	NA

ud4.4:0.2	The Spirit’s Blow	NA
ud4.4:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud4.4:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud4.4:1.3	At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near the pigeons’ alcove.	NA
ud4.4:1.4	Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was sitting outdoors in the moonlight, his head freshly shaven, having entered a certain state of immersion.	NA
ud4.4:2.1	Now at that time two native spirits who were friends were on their way from the north to the south on some business.	NA
ud4.4:2.2	They saw Sāriputta meditating there.	NA
ud4.4:2.3	One of the spirits said to the other,	NA
ud4.4:2.4	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!”	NA
ud4.4:2.5	The other spirit replied,	NA
ud4.4:2.6	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!	NA
ud4.4:2.7	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”	NA
ud4.4:3.1	For a second time the first spirit said to the other,	NA
ud4.4:3.2	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!”	NA
ud4.4:3.3	For a second time, the other spirit replied,	NA
ud4.4:3.4	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!	NA
ud4.4:3.5	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”	NA
ud4.4:3.6	For a third time the first spirit said to the other,	NA
ud4.4:3.7	“I feel inspired, friend, to give this ascetic a blow on the head!”	NA
ud4.4:3.8	For a third time, the other spirit replied,	NA
ud4.4:3.9	“Enough, friend, don’t hit the ascetic!	NA
ud4.4:3.10	That is an eminent ascetic, powerful and mighty!”	NA
ud4.4:4.1	Ignoring his friend, the first spirit struck Sāriputta.	NA
ud4.4:4.2	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.	NA
ud4.4:4.3	But then the spirit, crying out, “I burn, I burn!” fell into the Great Hell right there.	NA
ud4.4:5.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, Venerable Moggallāna saw that spirit striking Venerable Sāriputta.	NA
ud4.4:5.2	He approached him and said,	NA
ud4.4:5.3	“I hope you’re keeping well, reverend; I hope you’re all right. I hope that you are not in pain.”	NA
ud4.4:5.4	“I am keeping well, Reverend Moggallāna;	NA
ud4.4:5.5	but my head does hurt a little.”	NA
ud4.4:6.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing!	NA
ud4.4:6.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Sāriputta!	NA
ud4.4:6.3	Just now, a native spirit struck you on the head.	NA
ud4.4:6.4	The blow was so strong it would have felled a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits tall, or split apart a great mountain peak.	NA
ud4.4:6.5	Yet you say, ‘I am keeping well, Reverend Moggallāna;	NA
ud4.4:6.6	but my head does hurt a little.’”	NA
ud4.4:7.1	“It’s incredible, Reverend Moggallāna, it’s amazing!	NA
ud4.4:7.2	How mighty and powerful is Venerable Moggallāna, in that he can even see a native spirit!	NA
ud4.4:7.3	Whereas I can’t even see a mud-goblin right now.”	NA
ud4.4:8.1	With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion between those two spiritual giants.	NA
ud4.4:9.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.4:10.1	“One whose mind is like a rock,	NA
ud4.4:10.2	steady, never trembling,	NA
ud4.4:10.3	free of desire for desirable things,	NA

ud4.5:0.2	A Bull Elephant	NA
ud4.5:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud4.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
ud4.5:1.3	Now at that time Buddha lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	NA
ud4.5:1.4	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:1.5	Then he thought,	NA
ud4.5:1.6	“These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples.	NA
ud4.5:1.7	Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:1.8	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?”	NA
ud4.5:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.	NA
ud4.5:2.2	After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone towards Pārileyya, with no companion.	NA
ud4.5:2.3	When he eventually arrived,	NA
ud4.5:2.4	he stayed in a protected forest grove, at the foot of a sacred sal tree.	NA
ud4.5:3.1	A certain bull elephant was also living crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. He ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches he dragged down. He drank muddy water, and after his bath the female elephants bumped into him.	NA
ud4.5:3.2	Crowded, he lived in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:3.3	Then he thought,	NA
ud4.5:3.4	“These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:3.5	Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?”	NA
ud4.5:4.1	So he left the herd and went to Pārileyya, where he approached the Buddha in the protected forest grove at the foot of a sacred sal tree.	NA
ud4.5:4.2	There he attended on the Buddha, clearing the vegetation from the place where the Buddha stayed, and using his trunk to set out water for drinking and washing.	NA
ud4.5:5.1	Then as the Buddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
ud4.5:5.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Crowded, I live in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:5.3	But now I live uncrowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”	NA
ud4.5:6.1	And to the bull elephant also this thought came to mind,	NA
ud4.5:6.2	“Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Crowded, I lived in suffering and discomfort.	NA
ud4.5:6.3	But now I live uncrowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches I have dragged down. I don’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into me after my bath. Being uncrowded, I live in happiness and comfort.”	NA
ud4.5:7.1	Then, understanding his own seclusion and knowing that elephant’s train of thought, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.5:8.1	“The giant elephant,	NA
ud4.5:8.2	with tusks like chariot-poles,	NA
ud4.5:8.3	agrees heart to heart with the spiritual giant,	NA
ud4.5:8.4	since each finds joy in the woods alone.”	Commentary reads _vane araññe_, so text’s _mano_ must be wrong.

ud4.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud4.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Bhāradvāja the Alms-Gatherer was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight. He was one who lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes. He was of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic, an advocate of austerities, dedicated to the higher mind.	NA
ud4.6:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud4.6:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud4.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud4.7:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.7:4.1	“A sage of higher consciousness, diligent,	NA

ud4.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud4.8:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud4.8:1.4	And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud4.8:1.5	But the wanderers who followed other religions were not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud4.8:2.1	Then those wanderers who followed other religions, unable to bear the esteem of the mendicant Sangha, approached the female wanderer Sundarī and said,	NA
ud4.8:2.2	“Sister, are you able to do something for the welfare of your kin?”	Ānandajoti has “venture”, Ṭhānissaro has “dare”, but a similar phrase at [pli-tv-kd8:12.1.5]() clearly has the weaker sense of “able”, per Ireland and commentary (_ussahasīti sakkosi_).
ud4.8:2.3	“What can I do, masters?	NA
ud4.8:2.4	How can I help?	Accepting the variant _kiṁ mayā sakkā_, which is found in all similar passages. Reading, as Ṭhānissaro and Ānandajoti do, “what can I *not* do” is pleasingly dramatic, but not very idiomatic for Pali. Far more likely a simple reinforcement is meant. Commentary ignores this phrase, implying it thought there was nothing unusual.
ud4.8:2.5	I’d even give my life for the welfare of my kin.”	NA
ud4.8:3.1	“Well then, sister, frequently visit Jeta’s Grove.”	NA
ud4.8:3.2	“Yes, masters,” she replied, and did as they asked.	NA
ud4.8:4.1	When those wanderers knew	NA
ud4.8:4.2	that Sundarī had been clearly seen by many people frequently visiting Jeta’s Grove,	NA
ud4.8:4.3	they killed her and dumped her in the ditch around Jeta’s Grove. Then they went to see King Pasenadi of Kosala and said to him,	NA
ud4.8:4.4	“Great king, we cannot find the female wanderer Sundarī.”	NA
ud4.8:4.5	“But where do you suspect she is?”	NA
ud4.8:4.6	“At Jeta’s Grove, great king.”	NA
ud4.8:4.7	“Well then, search Jeta’s Grove.”	NA
ud4.8:5.1	So the wanderers searched Jeta’s Grove. They pulled her body up from the ditch where they had dumped it, and lifted it on a bier. Having entered Sāvatthī, they went from street to street and from square to square, complaining to people:	NA
ud4.8:6.1	“See the deed of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan!	NA
ud4.8:6.2	Shameless are these ascetics who follow the Sakyan, immoral and wicked. They are liars and unchaste.	NA
ud4.8:6.3	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be chaste, truthful, ethical, and of good character.	The idiom _ime hi nāma_ appears mildly emphatic in a disparaging way. Compare _kathaṁ hi nāma_ just below.
ud4.8:6.4	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.	NA
ud4.8:6.5	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!	NA
ud4.8:6.6	Where is their asceticism, where their spirituality?	NA
ud4.8:6.7	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!	NA
ud4.8:6.8	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”	NA
ud4.8:7.1	Then at that time when the people of Sāvatthī saw the mendicants they abused and insulted them with rude, harsh words:	NA
ud4.8:8.1	“Shameless are these ascetics who follow the Sakyan, immoral, wicked, liars, and fake chastes.	NA
ud4.8:8.2	Sure, they claim to be of principled and moral conduct, to be chaste, truthful, ethical, and of good character.	NA
ud4.8:8.3	But they have no asceticism, no spirituality.	NA
ud4.8:8.4	Asceticism and spirituality are lost to them!	NA

ud4.8:8.6	They have abandoned asceticism and spirituality!	NA
ud4.8:8.7	How on earth can a man, having done a man’s business, kill a woman!”	NA
ud4.8:9.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
ud4.8:9.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	NA
ud4.8:11.1	“That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.	NA
ud4.8:11.2	So you may respond to those critics with this verse:	NA
ud4.8:12.1	A liar goes to hell,	NA
ud4.8:12.2	as does one who denies what they did.	NA
ud4.8:12.3	Both are equal in the hereafter,	NA
ud4.8:12.4	those men of base deeds.”	NA
ud4.8:13.1	The mendicants memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, then used it to respond to those critics.	NA
ud4.8:15.1	People thought,	NA
ud4.8:15.2	“These ascetics who follow the Sakyan didn’t do it, it was not done by them, they swear it.”	NA
ud4.8:15.3	That rumor didn’t last long. It was seven days, then it vanished.	NA
ud4.8:16.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud4.8:17.1	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
ud4.8:17.2	How well said this was by the Buddha:	NA
ud4.8:17.3	‘That rumor, mendicants, won’t last long. It will only be seven days, then it will vanish.’	NA
ud4.8:17.4	That rumor has vanished, sir.”	NA
ud4.8:18.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud4.8:19.1	“People out of control stab with words,	NA
ud4.8:19.2	like they stab a tusker in battle with darts.	NA
ud4.8:19.3	When they hear a harsh word spoken,	NA
ud4.8:19.4	a mendicant should endure with no anger in heart.”	NA

ud4.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud4.9:1.3	Then as Venerable Upasena son of Vaṅgantā was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:	NA
ud4.9:1.4	“I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate!	NA
ud4.9:1.5	My Teacher is the Blessed One, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.	NA
ud4.9:1.6	Well explained is the teaching and training in which I have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.	NA

ud4.9:1.12	My life has been good, and my death will be good.”	NA
ud4.9:2.1	Then, knowing that Venerable Upasena’s train of thought, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud4.9:3.2	nor grief at facing death:	NA
ud4.9:3.3	that attentive one who has seen the truth,	NA

ud5.1:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.1:6.1	“Having explored every quarter with the mind,	NA

ud5.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
ud5.2:1.4	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!	NA
ud5.2:1.5	How short-lived was the Blessed One’s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods.”	Here I use “Blessed One” rather than my usual “Buddha” for _bhagavā_. Normally the difference is immaterial, as it is simply the most common way to address the Buddha. In this case, however, the passage Ānanda is referring to uses _bodhisatta_, and it is quite striking that he changes it here.
ud5.2:2.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda! For the mothers of beings intent of awakening are short-lived.	The Buddha switches back to _bodhisatta_, and depersonalizes it by using the plural.
ud5.2:2.2	Seven days after the beings intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of joyful gods.”	NA
ud5.2:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.2:4.1	“Whether born or to be born,	NA
ud5.2:4.2	all depart, leaving the body behind.	NA
ud5.2:4.3	The skillful, understanding that all is lost,	NA
ud5.2:4.4	would keenly practice the spiritual life.”	NA

ud5.3:0.2	With Suppabuddha the Leper	NA
ud5.3:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud5.3:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud5.3:1.3	At that time in Rājagaha there was a leper called Suppabuddha.	NA
ud5.3:1.4	He was a poor person, destitute, and pitiful.	NA
ud5.3:1.5	Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.	NA
ud5.3:2.1	Suppabuddha saw the crowd seated off in the distance	NA
ud5.3:2.2	and thought,	NA
ud5.3:2.3	“Surely some fresh and cooked foods will be distributed there.	NA
ud5.3:2.4	Why don’t I approach the crowd?	NA
ud5.3:2.5	Hopefully I’ll get something to eat.”	NA
ud5.3:3.1	So he approached the crowd	NA
ud5.3:3.2	where he saw the Buddha teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly.	NA
ud5.3:3.3	When he saw this he thought,	NA
ud5.3:3.4	“There’s no food being distributed here.	NA
ud5.3:3.5	The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma in an assembly.	NA
ud5.3:3.6	Why don’t I also listen to the teaching?”	NA
ud5.3:3.7	Right there he sat down to one side, thinking,	NA
ud5.3:3.8	“I also will listen to the teaching.”	NA
ud5.3:4.1	Then the Buddha focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the assembly, thinking,	NA
ud5.3:4.2	“Who here is capable of understanding the teaching?”	NA
ud5.3:4.3	He saw Suppabuddha sitting in the assembly,	It’s interesting to note that, despite the perhaps derogatory sense of _kuṭṭhi_ (“leper”), there is no question that Suppabuddha sits in the assembly and is not physically exlcuded.
ud5.3:4.4	and thought,	NA
ud5.3:4.5	“He is capable of understanding the teaching.”	NA
ud5.3:4.6	He gave a step by step talk especially for Suppabuddha	NA
ud5.3:4.7	on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.	NA
ud5.3:4.8	When the Buddha knew that Suppabuddha’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, elated, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:	NA
ud5.3:4.9	suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.	NA
ud5.3:4.10	Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,	NA
ud5.3:4.11	in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Suppabuddha:	NA
ud5.3:4.12	“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”	NA
ud5.3:5.1	Then Suppabuddha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He rose from his seat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:	NA
ud5.3:6.1	“Excellent, sir! Excellent!	NA
ud5.3:6.2	As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.	NA
ud5.3:6.3	I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.	NA
ud5.3:6.4	From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”	NA
ud5.3:7.1	After Suppabuddha had been educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving.	NA
ud5.3:7.2	But soon after Suppabuddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at him and took his life.	NA
ud5.3:8.1	Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,	NA
ud5.3:8.3	“The leper called Suppabuddha, after being educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, has passed away.	NA
ud5.3:8.4	Where has he been reborn in his next life?”	NA
ud5.3:9.1	“Mendicants, Suppabuddha was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.	NA
ud5.3:9.2	With the ending of three fetters, Suppabuddha is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”	NA
ud5.3:10.1	When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,	NA
ud5.3:10.2	“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Suppabuddha became a leper,	NA
ud5.3:10.3	a poor person, destitute, and pitiful?”	NA
ud5.3:11.1	“Once upon a time, mendicants, Suppabuddha used to be a financier’s son right here in Rājagaha.	NA
ud5.3:11.2	On his way to visit a park, he saw Tagarasikhī, an Independent Buddha, entering the city for alms.	NA
ud5.3:11.3	When he saw this he thought,	NA
ud5.3:11.4	“Who is this leper wandering about with his leper’s robe?”	NA
ud5.3:11.5	Before leaving, he spat on the ground and turned his left side to Tagarasikhī.	NA
ud5.3:11.6	As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years.	NA
ud5.3:11.7	And as a residual result of that same deed, he became a leper right here in Rājagaha, a poor person, destitute and pitiful.	NA
ud5.3:11.8	But owing to faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, he undertook ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.	NA
ud5.3:11.9	After undertaking these things, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
ud5.3:11.10	There he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory.”	NA
ud5.3:12.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.3:13.1	“As a clear-eyed man would avoid rough paths,	NA
ud5.3:13.2	so long as strength is found;	NA
ud5.3:13.3	an astute person in the living world,	NA

ud5.4:1.3	Now at that time, between Sāvatthī and the Jeta Grove, several boys were tormenting some fish.	NA
ud5.4:2.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.	NA
ud5.4:2.2	He saw the boys tormenting the fish.	NA
ud5.4:2.3	He went to them and said,	NA
ud5.4:2.4	“Boys, do you fear pain? Do you dislike pain?”	NA
ud5.4:2.5	“Yes, sir,” they replied. “We dislike pain.”	NA

ud5.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
ud5.5:1.3	Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.	NA
ud5.5:2.1	And then, as the night was getting late, in the first watch of the night, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud5.5:2.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the first watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long.	NA
ud5.5:2.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	NA
ud5.5:2.4	But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.	NA
ud5.5:3.1	For a second time, as the night was getting late, in the middle watch of the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud5.5:3.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the middle watch of the night, and the Saṅgha of monks has been sitting long.	NA
ud5.5:3.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	NA
ud5.5:3.4	But for a second time the Buddha kept silent.	NA
ud5.5:4.1	For a third time, as the night was getting late, in the last watch of the night, as dawn stirred, bringing joy to the night, Ānanda got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said,	NA
ud5.5:4.2	“Sir, the night is getting late. It is the last watch of the night and dawn stirs, bringing joy to the night.	NA
ud5.5:4.3	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	NA
ud5.5:4.4	“Ānanda, the assembly is not pure.”	NA
ud5.5:5.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,	NA
ud5.5:5.2	“Who is the Buddha talking about?”	NA
ud5.5:5.4	Then he focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha.	NA
ud5.5:5.5	He saw that unethical person, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, festering, and depraved, sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha.	NA
ud5.5:5.6	When he saw him he got up from his seat, went up to him and said,	NA
ud5.5:5.7	“Get up, reverend. The Buddha has seen you.	NA
ud5.5:5.8	You can’t live in communion with the monks.”	NA
ud5.5:5.9	But when he said this, that person kept silent.	NA
ud5.5:6.1	For a second time and a third time,	NA
ud5.5:6.2	he asked that monk to leave.	NA
ud5.5:6.5	But for a third time that person kept silent.	NA
ud5.5:7.1	Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna took that person by the arm, ejected him out the gate, and bolted the door. Then he went up to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
ud5.5:7.2	“I have ejected that person.	NA
ud5.5:7.3	The assembly is pure.	NA
ud5.5:7.4	Please, sir, may the Buddha recite the monastic code to the monks.”	NA
ud5.5:7.5	“It’s incredible, Moggallāna, it’s amazing,	NA
ud5.5:7.6	how that futile man waited to be taken by the arm!”	NA
ud5.5:8.1	Then the Buddha said to the monks,	NA
ud5.5:8.2	“From this day forth, monks, I will not perform the sabbath or recite the monastic code.	NA
ud5.5:8.3	Now you should perform the sabbath and recite the monastic code.	NA
ud5.5:8.4	It’s impossible, monks, it can’t happen that a Realized One could recite the monastic code in an impure assembly.	NA
ud5.5:9.1	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:9.2	What eight?	NA
ud5.5:10.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice.	NA
ud5.5:10.3	This is the first thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:11.1	Furthermore, the ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries.	NA
ud5.5:11.3	This is the second thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:12.1	Furthermore, the ocean doesn’t accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach.	NA
ud5.5:12.3	This is the third thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:13.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’.	NA
ud5.5:13.3	This is the fourth thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:14.1	Furthermore, for all the world’s streams that reach it, and the showers that fall from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up.	NA
ud5.5:14.3	This is the fifth thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:15.1	Furthermore, the ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt.	NA
ud5.5:15.3	This is the sixth thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:16.1	Furthermore, the ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies, and emeralds.	NA
ud5.5:16.3	This is the seventh thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:17.1	Furthermore, many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long.	NA
ud5.5:17.3	This is the eighth thing the titans love about the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:17.4	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things the titans love the ocean.	NA
ud5.5:18.1	In the same way, seeing eight incredible and amazing things, mendicants, the mendicants love this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:18.2	What eight?	NA
ud5.5:19.1	The ocean gradually slants, slopes, and inclines, with no abrupt precipice.	NA
ud5.5:19.2	In the same way in this teaching and training the penetration to enlightenment comes from gradual training, progress, and practice, not abruptly.	NA
ud5.5:19.4	This is the first thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:20.1	The ocean is consistent and doesn’t overflow its boundaries.	NA
ud5.5:20.2	In the same way, when a training rule is laid down for my disciples they wouldn’t break it even for the sake of their own life.	NA
ud5.5:20.4	This is the second thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:21.1	The ocean doesn’t accommodate a carcass, but quickly carries it to the shore and strands it on the beach.	NA
ud5.5:21.2	In the same way, the Saṅgha doesn’t accommodate a person who is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, festering, and depraved. But they quickly gather and expel them. Even if such a person is sitting in the middle of the Saṅgha, they’re far from the Saṅgha, and the Saṅgha is far from them.	NA
ud5.5:21.4	This is the third thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:22.1	Furthermore, when they reach the ocean, all the great rivers—that is, the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—lose their names and clans and are simply considered ‘the ocean’.	NA
ud5.5:22.2	In the same way, when they go forth from the lay life to homelessness, all four classes—aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials—lose their former names and clans and are simply considered ‘ascetics who follow the Sakyan’.	NA
ud5.5:22.4	This is the fourth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:23.1	For all the world’s streams that reach it, and the showers that fall from the sky, the ocean never empties or fills up.	NA
ud5.5:23.2	In the same way, though several mendicants become fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue, the element of extinguishment never empties or fills up.	NA
ud5.5:23.4	This is the fifth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:24.1	The ocean has just one taste, the taste of salt.	NA
ud5.5:24.2	In the same way, this teaching and training has one taste, the taste of freedom.	NA
ud5.5:24.4	This is the sixth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:25.1	The ocean is full of many kinds of treasures, such as pearls, gems, beryl, conch, quartz, coral, silver, native gold, rubies, and emeralds.	NA
ud5.5:25.2	In the same way, this teaching and training is full of many kinds of treasures, such as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.	NA
ud5.5:25.4	This is the seventh thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:26.1	Many great beings live in the ocean, such as leviathans, leviathan-gulpers, leviathan-gulper-gulpers, titans, dragons, and centaurs. In the ocean there are life-forms a hundred leagues long, or even two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred leagues long.	NA
ud5.5:26.2	In the same way, great beings live in this teaching and training, and these are those beings. The stream-enterer and the one practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry. The once-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of once-return. The non-returner and the one practicing to realize the fruit of non-return. The perfected one, and the one practicing for perfection.	NA
ud5.5:26.4	This is the eighth thing the mendicants love about this teaching and training.	NA
ud5.5:26.5	Seeing these eight incredible and amazing things, the mendicants love this teaching and training.”	NA
ud5.5:27.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.5:28.1	“The rain saturates things that are covered up;	NA
ud5.5:28.2	it doesn’t saturate things that are open.	NA
ud5.5:28.3	Therefore you should open up a covered thing,	NA
ud5.5:28.4	so the rain will not saturate it.”	NA
ud5.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 5.6	NA
ud5.6:0.2	With Soṇa	NA
ud5.6:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud5.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud5.6:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain.	NA
ud5.6:1.4	And the layman Soṇa of the Sharp Ears was Mahākaccāna’s attendant.	NA
ud5.6:2.1	Then as Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
ud5.6:2.2	“As I understand Master Mahākaccāna’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
ud5.6:2.3	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	NA
ud5.6:3.1	Then Soṇa went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then he said,	NA
ud5.6:4.4	“May Master Mahākaccāna please give me the going forth!”	NA
ud5.6:5.1	When this was said, Mahākaccāna said to him,	NA
ud5.6:5.2	“It’s hard to lead the spiritual life as long as you live, eating in one part of the day and sleeping alone.	NA
ud5.6:5.3	Come now, Soṇa, while remaining a layperson just as you are, devote yourself to the instructions of the Buddhas, leading the spiritual life at suitable times, eating in one part of the day and sleeping alone.”	NA
ud5.6:5.4	Then Soṇa’s aspiration to go forth died down.	NA
ud5.6:6.1	For a second time, while in private retreat the thought came to Soṇa that he should go forth, but the outcome was the same.	NA
ud5.6:7.1	For a third time, as Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
ud5.6:7.2	“As I understand Master Mahākaccāna’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.	NA
ud5.6:7.3	Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”	NA
ud5.6:7.4	For a third time, Soṇa went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then he said,	NA
ud5.6:8.4	“May Master Mahākaccāna please give me the going forth!”	NA
ud5.6:9.1	Then Mahākaccāna gave Soṇa the going forth.	NA
ud5.6:9.2	Now at that time the southern region, including Avanti, was short of monks.	NA
ud5.6:9.3	It took three years and much struggle and difficulty before Venerable Mahākaccāyana was able to assemble from here and there a Sangha consisting of ten monks and give Venerable Soṇa the full ordination.	NA
ud5.6:10.1	Then as Venerable Soṇa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,	NA
ud5.6:10.2	“I have not personally seen the Buddha. I have only heard reports that	NA
ud5.6:10.3	that Blessed One is like this or like that.	NA
ud5.6:10.4	If my mentor allows, I should go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”	NA
ud5.6:11.1	Then in the late afternoon, Soṇa came out of retreat, went up to Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what he was thinking. Then Mahākaccāna said,	NA
ud5.6:13.1	“Good, good, Soṇa!	NA
ud5.6:13.2	Go to see the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.	NA
ud5.6:13.3	You will see that Blessed One who is impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties.	NA
ud5.6:13.4	On seeing him, in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably, saying,	NA
ud5.6:13.5	‘Sir, my mentor Venerable Mahākaccāna bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’”	NA
ud5.6:14.1	Saying, “Yes, sir,” Soṇa welcomed and agreed with Mahākaccāna’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Mahākaccāna, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.	NA
ud5.6:14.2	Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
ud5.6:14.3	Soṇa said to the Buddha,	NA
ud5.6:14.4	“Sir, my mentor Venerable Mahākaccāna bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”	NA
ud5.6:15.1	“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you have arrived from your journey unwearied, having had no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
ud5.6:15.2	“I’m keeping well, Blessed One; I’m all right. And I have arrived from my journey unwearied, having had no trouble getting almsfood.”	NA
ud5.6:16.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud5.6:16.2	“Prepare lodgings for this visiting mendicant.”	NA
ud5.6:16.3	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
ud5.6:16.4	“When the Buddha orders me	NA
ud5.6:16.5	to prepare lodgings for a specific mendicant, he wishes to stay in the same dwelling with that mendicant. The Buddha wishes to stay together with Venerable Soṇa.”	NA
ud5.6:16.6	He prepared lodgings for Soṇa in the same dwelling where the Buddha was staying.	NA
ud5.6:17.1	The Buddha spent much of the night sitting meditation in the open. Then he got up from his seat, washed his feet and entered the dwelling.	NA
ud5.6:17.2	Venerable Soṇa did the same.	NA
ud5.6:17.3	Then the Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Soṇa,	NA
ud5.6:17.4	“Speak some Dhamma, mendicant, as you feel inspired.”	NA
ud5.6:18.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Soṇa. He intoned all sixteen discourses in the Chapter of the Eights.	The Vinaya version of this passage omits “sixteen” ([pli-tv-kd5:13.9.5]()). | _Sarena abhaṇi_ means “recite with tones”, apparently a reference to a chanting style that made use of or echoed the Vedic tonal system (_svara_).
ud5.6:18.2	When Soṇa finished his intoning, the Buddha applauded, saying,	NA
ud5.6:18.3	“Good, good, mendicant! You have learned the sixteen discourses of the Chapter of the Eights well, you have applied the mind and remembered it well. You are a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning.	NA
ud5.6:18.4	How many rains have you been ordained, mendicant?”	NA
ud5.6:18.5	“I have one rains, Blessed One.”	NA
ud5.6:18.6	“But why did it take you so long to make it?”	NA
ud5.6:18.7	“Sir, I have long seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures,	NA
ud5.6:18.8	yet living in a house is cramped, with many duties and much to do.”	NA
ud5.6:19.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.6:20.1	“Seeing the danger of the world,	NA
ud5.6:20.2	I understood the truth without attachments.	NA
ud5.6:20.3	The Noble One does not delight in evil,	NA
ud5.6:20.4	the Pure One does not delight in evil.”	NA
ud5.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 5.7	NA
ud5.7:0.2	With Revata the Doubter	NA
ud5.7:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud5.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud5.7:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Revata the Doubter was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, with his body straight, reviewing his own purification by traversing doubt.	NA
ud5.7:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud5.7:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.7:4.1	“Any doubts about this world or the world beyond,	NA
ud5.7:4.2	about one’s own experiences or those of another:	NA
ud5.7:4.3	those who meditate give them all up,	NA

ud5.8:0.2	Schism in the Saṅgha	NA
ud5.8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud5.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud5.8:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
ud5.8:2.1	Devadatta saw him wandering for alms,	NA
ud5.8:2.2	so he went up to him and said,	NA
ud5.8:2.3	“From this day forth, Reverend Ānanda, I shall perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha apart from the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.”	NA
ud5.8:3.1	Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,	NA
ud5.8:3.2	and told him what had just happened, adding:	NA
ud5.8:4.5	“Today, sir, Devadatta will split the Saṅgha. He will perform the sabbath and legal proceedings of the Saṅgha.”	NA
ud5.8:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.8:6.1	“It’s easy for the good to do good,	NA
ud5.8:6.2	but for the bad, doing good is hard.	NA
ud5.8:6.3	For the bad, it’s easy to do bad,	NA
ud5.8:6.4	but for the noble ones, doing bad is hard.”	NA
ud5.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 5.9	NA
ud5.9:0.2	Teasing	NA
ud5.9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud5.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.	NA
ud5.9:1.3	Now at that time several young students were passing by not far from the Buddha in a teasing manner.	NA
ud5.9:1.4	The Buddha saw them.	NA
ud5.9:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.9:3.1	“Dolts pretending to be astute,	NA
ud5.9:3.2	they talk, their words out of bounds.	NA
ud5.9:3.3	They blab at will, their mouths agape,	NA

ud5.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud5.10:1.3	Now at that time Venerable Cūḷapanthaka was sitting not far from the Buddha, cross-legged, his body set straight, and mindfulness established in his presence.	NA
ud5.10:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud5.10:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud5.10:4.1	“Steady in body, steady in mind,	NA
ud5.10:4.2	standing, sitting or lying down:	NA
ud5.10:4.3	a mendicant focusing on this mindfulness	NA

ud6.1:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 6.1	NA
ud6.1:0.2	Surrendering the Life Force	NA
ud6.1:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud6.1:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.	NA
ud6.1:1.3	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.	NA
ud6.1:1.4	Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:	NA
ud6.1:1.5	“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.	NA
ud6.1:1.6	Let’s go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day’s meditation.”	NA
ud6.1:2.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.	NA
ud6.1:2.2	Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla Shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
ud6.1:2.3	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
ud6.1:3.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
ud6.1:3.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years.
ud6.1:3.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA
ud6.1:4.1	But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.	NA
ud6.1:4.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
ud6.1:4.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
ud6.1:4.4	For a second time …	NA
ud6.1:4.5	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	NA
ud6.1:5.1	“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely.	NA
ud6.1:5.2	Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.	NA
ud6.1:5.3	The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.”	NA

ud6.1:6.2	He didn’t beg the Buddha,	NA
ud6.1:6.3	“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.	NA
ud6.1:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA

ud6.2:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud6.2:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	The same narrative introduces different verses at [sn3.11]().
ud6.2:1.3	Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate.	NA
ud6.2:1.4	Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.	NA
ud6.2:2.1	Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their pack with shoulder-poles.	“Matted-hair ascetics” (_jaṭilā_) were Vedic ascetics practicing bathing and worshiping the sacred flame ([ud1.9](); see note on [mn40:5.10]()). | “Jain ascetics” (_nigaṇṭhā_) were followers of Mahāvīra. The list is perhaps confused, for the next two types appear to be the two main subsets of Jains: the Digambara were “naked ascetics” (_acelakā_), while Śvetāmbara were “one-cloth ascetics” (see [an6.57:4.1]()). | “Wanderers (_paribbājakā_) were homeless religious renunciates—male or female—who wandered seeking alms (see note on [dn1:1.1.3]()). | For _khāri_ (“pack”) see also [sn7.9:14.1]().
ud6.2:3.1	King Pasenadi saw them passing by.	NA
ud6.2:3.2	He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times:	NA
ud6.2:3.3	“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	NA
ud6.2:3.4	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!	NA
ud6.2:3.5	I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”	NA
ud6.2:4.1	Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud6.2:4.2	“Sir, these are among those in the world who are perfected or who are on the path to perfection!”	This sentence is phrased as a statement in all editions here, and in the parallel passage at [ud6.2:4.2]() all except the PTS edition, where it is a question. The commentary in both places confirms it is meant as a statement (_“ime arahanto”ti vutte_). Pasenadi is testing the Buddha.
ud6.2:5.1	“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and currency, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.	NA

ud6.2:7.2	how well said this was by the Buddha. …	NA
ud6.2:8.1	Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country.	The use of ascetics for spies, which is still common today, is detailed by Kauṭilya in his Arthaśāstra. Those seeking a job can imitate bald (_muṇḍa_) or matted-hair (_jaṭila_) ascetics, pretending to live on a handful of greens but secretly eating what they like (as here). Other fake ascetics or spies disguised as merchants then acclaim them to build reputation (as Pasenadi here). When people seek prophecies, he foretells that those loyal to the king shall prosper and those who oppose him will suffer. The king’s minister then ensures that such prophecies come true (1.11.13, 1.13.15). Female mendicants are especially useful for manipulating the wives of officials (5.1.19, 5.1.50, 12.2.20), or officials regarding their wives (11.1.52). Ascetic spies are taught to manipulate loyalties with morality tales (1.14) and to fool enemy kings by faking magical powers (13.2; cp. Devadatta using magic to seduce Ajātasattu at [pli-tv-kd17:2.1.1]()). They conduct assassinations by tricking targets into consuming poisons in the guise of a ritual (5.1.33) or love-potions (11.1.40), or he may first instigate rape, then accuse the rapist (11.1.48). Princes may also don the guise of such ascetics in order to escape a coup, while forest ascetics misdirect pursuers (7.17.50). Such spies earn a solid middle income comparable to soldiers, superintendents, teachers, or accountants (5.3.22–3).
ud6.2:8.2	I shall later make use of what they first spied out.	Readings for _osāpayissāmi_ are highly uncertain, and the sentence may be corrupt. Udāna commentary glosses _paṭipajjissāmi karissāmi_, which suggests Sanskrit _apāśri_, “employ, practice, use”.
ud6.2:8.3	Now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.”	NA
ud6.2:9.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud6.2:10.1	“Don’t strive in every situation,	NA
ud6.2:10.2	don’t become another’s man.	NA
ud6.2:10.3	Don’t live depending on another,	NA
ud6.2:10.4	and don’t use the teaching to make money.”	The commentary says, “Don’t teach the Dhamma for the sake of money, etc.”

ud6.8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud6.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud6.8:1.3	Now at that time two gangs were both hopelessly in love with a certain courtesan.	NA
ud6.8:1.4	Quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attacked each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords,	NA
ud6.8:1.5	resulting in death and deadly pain.	NA
ud6.8:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms.	NA
ud6.8:2.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.	NA
ud6.8:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud6.8:5.1	“What has been attained and what is to be attained are both strewn over with dust for that one training while still sick.	NA
ud6.8:5.2	Those for whom the training is the essence, or precepts and observances, chastity, and service as the essence: this is one extreme.	NA
ud6.8:5.3	Those who say,	NA
ud6.8:5.4	‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’: this is the second extreme.	NA
ud6.8:5.5	Thus these two extremes swell the charnel grounds, while the charnel grounds swell wrong view.	NA
ud6.8:5.6	Not realizing these two extremes, some get stuck and some overreach.	NA
ud6.8:5.7	Those who realize these things, who were not found there, who did not conceive by that, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found.”	NA

ud6.9:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while oil lamps were burning.	NA
ud6.9:2.1	And many moths were falling down and crashing down into the lamps, coming to grief and ruin.	NA
ud6.9:2.2	The Buddha saw the moths coming to grief.	NA
ud6.9:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud6.9:4.1	“Hastening by, they miss the essence,	NA
ud6.9:4.2	sprouting ever more new bonds.	NA
ud6.9:4.3	Like moths falling in the flame,	NA

ud6.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud6.10:1.3	Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
ud6.10:2.1	“Sir, so long as the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas do not arise in the world, the wanderers of other religions are honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud6.10:2.2	But when the Realized Ones do arise in the world, the wanderers of other religions are no longer honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they do not receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud6.10:2.3	Now only the Buddha is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”	NA
ud6.10:3.1	“That’s so true, Ānanda. So long as the Realized Ones do not arise in the world, the wanderers of other religions are honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.	NA
ud6.10:3.2	But when the Realized Ones do arise in the world, the wanderers of other religions are no longer honored in this way.	NA
ud6.10:3.3	Now only the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And so does the mendicant Saṅgha.”	NA
ud6.10:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud6.10:5.1	“The glow-worm shines so long	NA
ud6.10:5.2	as the beacon of the sun does not rise.	NA
ud6.10:5.3	But when the sun has come up,	NA
ud6.10:5.4	that light is erased and shines no more.	NA

ud7.4:4.1	“Blinded by sensual pleasures, wrapped in a net,	NA
ud7.4:4.2	they are smothered over by craving;	NA
ud7.4:4.3	bound by the kinsman of the negligent,	NA

ud7.5:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud7.5:1.3	Then Venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf, closely following several mendicants, approached the Buddha.	NA
ud7.5:2.1	The Buddha saw Venerable Bhaddiya coming off in the distance—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by most of the mendicants.	NA
ud7.5:2.2	The Buddha addressed the mendicants:	NA
ud7.5:3.1	“Mendicants, do you see this monk coming—ugly, unsightly, deformed, and despised by most of the mendicants?”	NA
ud7.5:3.2	“Yes, sir.”	NA
ud7.5:4.1	“That mendicant is very mighty and powerful. It’s not easy to find an attainment that he has not already attained.	NA
ud7.5:4.2	And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”	NA
ud7.5:5.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud7.6:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA

ud7.7:1.3	Now at that time the Buddha was sitting reviewing his own giving up of the judgments driven by the proliferation of perceptions.	“Judgment” (_saṅkhā_) refers to the way we “appraise” or “assess” ourselves, especially in relation to others (cf. [mn1:3.3](), [dn1:1.3.2]()). | “Proliferation” (_papañca_) is the compulsion of the mind to spread out in endless inner commentary that hides reality. | “Perceptions” refer to the underlying tendencies that cause us to interpret the present in terms of the past. See [mn18]() for a detailed explanation.
ud7.7:2.1	Then, understanding his own giving up of the judgments driven by the proliferation of perceptions, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud7.7:3.1	“There is no proliferation remaining in those	NA
ud7.7:3.2	who have gone beyond the reins and cross-bar.	NA

ud7.8:2.1	The Buddha saw him meditating there.	NA
ud7.8:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud7.9:0.2	The Well	NA
ud7.9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud7.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a brahmin town of the Mallas named Thūṇa.	NA
ud7.9:1.3	The brahmins and householders of Thūṇa heard:	NA
ud7.9:1.4	“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Mallas has arrived at Thūṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.”	NA
ud7.9:1.5	They filled the well with grass and hay right to the top, thinking,	NA
ud7.9:1.6	“Don’t let these shavelings, these fake ascetics drink the water.”	NA
ud7.9:2.1	And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a tree, and sat down on the seat spread out.	NA
ud7.9:2.2	When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:	NA
ud7.9:2.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water from that well.”	NA
ud7.9:3.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
ud7.9:3.2	“Just now, sir, the brahimns and householders of Thūṇa filled the well with grass and hay right to the top, thinking,	NA
ud7.9:3.3	‘Don’t let these shavelings, these fake ascetics drink the water.’”	NA
ud7.9:4.1	For a second time,	NA
ud7.9:4.2	and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:	NA
ud7.9:4.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water from that well.”	NA
ud7.9:4.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the well.	NA
ud7.9:4.5	As he approached the well, all the grass and hay erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow.	NA
ud7.9:5.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
ud7.9:5.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
ud7.9:5.3	For when I approached this well, all the grass and hay erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow.”	NA
ud7.9:5.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
ud7.9:5.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
ud7.9:5.6	For when I approached that well, all the grass and hay erupted out of the well-mouth. The water stood transparent, unclouded, and clear right up to the top, seeming to overflow.	NA
ud7.9:5.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!”	NA
ud7.9:6.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud7.9:7.1	“What difference would a well make	NA
ud7.9:7.2	if water is there all the time?	NA
ud7.9:7.3	Having cut off craving at the root,	NA

ud7.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.	NA
ud7.10:1.3	Now at that time, while King Udena was visiting a park, his royal compound burned down. Five hundred women died, with Queen Sāmāvatī at their head.	NA
ud7.10:2.1	Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Kosambī for alms.	NA
ud7.10:2.2	Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him had happened. They asked the Buddha,	NA
ud7.10:2.5	“Sir, where have those laywomen been reborn in the next life?”	NA
ud7.10:3.1	“Among those laywomen there were stream-enterers, once-returners, and non-returners.	NA
ud7.10:3.2	None of those laywomen died without some fruit of the practice.”	NA
ud7.10:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud7.10:5.3	The fool caught up in attachment	NA

ud8.1:1.4	And those mendicants were paying attention, applying the mind, concentrating wholeheartedly, and actively listening.	NA
ud8.1:2.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA

ud8.5:2.6	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
ud8.5:3.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.	NA
ud8.5:3.2	And when the night had passed Cunda had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA

ud8.5:6.1	After the Buddha had eaten Cunda’s meal, he fell severely ill with bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.	NA
ud8.5:6.2	But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness.	NA
ud8.5:7.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud8.5:7.2	“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Kusinārā.”	NA
ud8.5:7.3	“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.	NA
ud8.5:8.1	I’ve heard that after eating	NA
ud8.5:8.2	the meal of Cunda the smith,	NA
ud8.5:8.3	the attentive one fell severely ill,	NA
ud8.5:8.4	with pains, close to death.	NA
ud8.5:9.1	A severe sickness struck the Teacher	NA
ud8.5:9.2	who had eaten the pork on the turn.	NA
ud8.5:9.3	While still purging the Buddha said:	NA
ud8.5:9.4	“I’ll go to the citadel of Kusinārā.”	NA
ud8.5:10.1	Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree, where he addressed Ānanda,	NA
ud8.5:10.2	“Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down.”	NA
ud8.5:10.3	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked.	NA
ud8.5:10.4	The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,	NA
ud8.5:10.5	and said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud8.5:10.6	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	NA
ud8.5:11.1	When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,	NA
ud8.5:11.2	“Sir, just now around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky.	NA
ud8.5:11.3	The Kakutthā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.	NA
ud8.5:11.4	There the Buddha can drink and cool his limbs.”	NA
ud8.5:12.1	For a second time,	NA
ud8.5:12.2	and a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda,	NA
ud8.5:12.3	“Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.”	NA
ud8.5:12.4	“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river.	NA
ud8.5:12.5	Now, though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	NA
ud8.5:13.1	Then Venerable Ānanda thought,	NA
ud8.5:13.2	“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
ud8.5:13.3	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.”	NA
ud8.5:13.4	Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him,	NA
ud8.5:13.5	“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might!	NA
ud8.5:13.6	For though the shallow water in that river had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.	NA
ud8.5:13.7	Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!”	NA
ud8.5:14.1	So the Buddha drank the water.	NA
ud8.5:14.2	Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank.	NA
ud8.5:14.3	And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka,	NA
ud8.5:14.4	“Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.”	NA
ud8.5:15.1	“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked.	NA
ud8.5:15.2	And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.	NA
ud8.5:15.3	But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha.	NA
ud8.5:16.1	Having gone to Kakutthā Creek,	NA
ud8.5:16.2	whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear,	NA
ud8.5:16.3	the Teacher, being tired, plunged in,	NA
ud8.5:16.4	the Realized One, without compare in the world.	NA
ud8.5:17.1	And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged.	NA
ud8.5:17.2	Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, <j>the Buddha,	NA
ud8.5:17.3	the Teacher who rolled forth <j>the present dispensation,	NA
ud8.5:17.4	the great seer went to the mango grove.	NA
ud8.5:17.5	He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka:	NA
ud8.5:17.6	“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.”	NA
ud8.5:18.1	The evolved one urged Cunda,	NA
ud8.5:18.2	who quickly spread the folded robe.	NA
ud8.5:18.3	The Teacher lay down so tired,	NA
ud8.5:18.4	while Cunda sat there before him.	NA
ud8.5:19.1	Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,	NA
ud8.5:19.2	“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smith:	NA
ud8.5:19.3	‘It’s your loss, friend Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.’	NA
ud8.5:19.4	You should get rid of remorse in Cunda the smith like this:	NA
ud8.5:20.1	‘You’re fortunate, friend Cunda, you’re so very fortunate,	NA
ud8.5:20.2	in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.	NA
ud8.5:20.3	I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.	NA
ud8.5:20.4	There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	NA
ud8.5:20.5	What two?	NA
ud8.5:20.6	The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue.	NA
ud8.5:20.7	These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.	NA
ud8.5:21.1	You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, glory, heaven, and sovereignty.’	NA
ud8.5:21.2	You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this.”	NA
ud8.5:22.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.5:23.1	“A giver’s merit grows;	NA
ud8.5:23.2	enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control.	NA
ud8.5:23.3	A skillful person gives up bad things—	NA
ud8.5:23.4	with the end of greed, hate, and delusion, <j>they’re quenched.”	NA
ud8.6:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 8.6	NA
ud8.6:0.2	The Layfolk of Pāṭali Village	NA
ud8.6:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud8.6:1.2	At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at the village of Pāṭali.	NA
ud8.6:1.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrived.	NA
ud8.6:1.5	So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,	NA
ud8.6:1.7	“Sir, please consent to come to our guest house.”	NA
ud8.6:1.8	The Buddha consented with silence.	NA
ud8.6:2.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying:	NA
ud8.6:2.3	“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”	NA
ud8.6:3.1	In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing east.	NA
ud8.6:3.2	The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
ud8.6:3.3	The lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.	NA
ud8.6:3.4	Then the Buddha addressed them:	NA
ud8.6:4.1	“Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	NA
ud8.6:4.2	What five?	NA
ud8.6:4.3	Firstly, an unethical person loses great wealth on account of negligence.	NA
ud8.6:4.4	This is the first drawback.	NA
ud8.6:5.1	Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation.	NA
ud8.6:5.2	This is the second drawback.	NA
ud8.6:6.1	Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	NA
ud8.6:6.2	This is the third drawback.	NA
ud8.6:7.1	Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die.	NA
ud8.6:7.2	This is the fourth drawback.	NA
ud8.6:8.1	Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.	NA
ud8.6:8.2	This is the fifth drawback.	NA
ud8.6:8.3	These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics.	NA
ud8.6:9.1	There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.	NA
ud8.6:9.2	What five?	NA
ud8.6:9.3	Firstly, an ethical person gains great wealth on account of diligence.	NA
ud8.6:9.4	This is the first benefit.	NA
ud8.6:10.1	Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation.	NA
ud8.6:10.2	This is the second benefit.	NA
ud8.6:11.1	Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and self-assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics.	NA
ud8.6:11.2	This is the third benefit.	NA
ud8.6:12.1	Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost.	NA
ud8.6:12.2	This is the fourth benefit.	NA
ud8.6:13.1	Furthermore, when an ethical person’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.	NA
ud8.6:13.2	This is the fifth benefit.	NA
ud8.6:13.3	These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.”	NA
ud8.6:14.1	The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them,	NA
ud8.6:14.2	“The night is getting late, householders. Please go at your convenience.”	NA
ud8.6:14.3	And then the lay followers of Pāṭali Village approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.	NA
ud8.6:14.4	Soon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicle.	NA
ud8.6:15.1	Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis out.	NA
ud8.6:15.2	At that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village.	NA
ud8.6:15.3	Illustrious rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	NA
ud8.6:15.4	Middling rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	NA
ud8.6:15.5	Lesser rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	NA
ud8.6:16.1	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village,	NA
ud8.6:16.2	and the people building houses in accord with the station of the deities.	NA
ud8.6:16.5	The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda,	NA
ud8.6:17.1	“Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?”	NA
ud8.6:17.2	“Sir, the Magadhan chief ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out.”	NA
ud8.6:17.3	“It’s as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the thirty-three.	NA
ud8.6:17.5	With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw those deities taking possession of building sites.	NA
ud8.6:17.6	Illustrious rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities.	NA
ud8.6:17.7	Middling rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities.	NA
ud8.6:17.8	Lesser rulers or royal chief ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities.	NA
ud8.6:17.9	As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center.	NA
ud8.6:17.10	But Pāṭaliputta will face three threats:	NA
ud8.6:17.11	from fire, flood, and dissension.”	NA
ud8.6:18.1	Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.	NA
ud8.6:18.2	When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said,	NA
ud8.6:18.4	“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?”	NA
ud8.6:19.1	Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared. Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,	NA
ud8.6:19.2	“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.”	NA
ud8.6:20.1	Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.	NA
ud8.6:20.2	Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.	NA
ud8.6:21.1	When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side.	NA
ud8.6:21.2	The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:	NA
ud8.6:22.1	“In the place he makes his dwelling,	NA
ud8.6:22.2	having fed the astute	NA
ud8.6:22.3	and the virtuous here,	NA
ud8.6:22.4	the restrained spiritual practitioners,	NA
ud8.6:23.1	he should dedicate an offering	NA
ud8.6:23.2	to the deities there.	NA
ud8.6:23.3	Venerated, they venerate him;	NA
ud8.6:23.4	honored, they honor him.	NA
ud8.6:24.1	After that they have sympathy for him,	NA
ud8.6:24.2	like a mother for the child at her breast.	NA
ud8.6:24.3	A man beloved of the deities	NA
ud8.6:24.4	always sees nice things.”	NA
ud8.6:25.1	When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left.	NA
ud8.6:26.1	Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking,	NA
ud8.6:26.2	“The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama Gate.	NA
ud8.6:26.3	The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.”	NA
ud8.6:27.1	Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama Gate.	NA
ud8.6:27.2	Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River.	NA
ud8.6:27.3	Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.	NA
ud8.6:27.4	Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft.	NA
ud8.6:27.5	But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore.	NA
ud8.6:28.1	He saw all those humans wanting to cross over.	NA
ud8.6:29.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.6:30.1	“Those who cross a deluge or stream	NA
ud8.6:30.2	have built a bridge and left the marshes behind.	NA
ud8.6:30.3	While some people are still tying a raft,	NA
ud8.6:30.4	intelligent people have crossed over.”	NA
ud8.7:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 8.7	NA
ud8.7:0.2	A Fork in the Road	NA
ud8.7:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud8.7:1.2	At one time the Buddha was traveling along a road in the Kosalan lands with Venerable Nāgasamāla as his second monk.	NA
ud8.7:1.3	Nāgasamāla saw a fork in the road	NA
ud8.7:1.4	and said to the Buddha,	NA
ud8.7:1.5	“Sir, this is the road,	NA
ud8.7:1.6	let us go this way.”	NA
ud8.7:1.7	But when he said this the Buddha responded,	NA
ud8.7:1.8	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road,	NA
ud8.7:1.9	let us go this way.”	NA
ud8.7:2.1	For a second time,	NA
ud8.7:2.2	and a third time Nāgasamāla said to the Buddha,	NA
ud8.7:2.3	“Sir, this is the road,	NA
ud8.7:2.4	let us go this way.”	NA
ud8.7:2.5	And for a third time the Buddha responded,	NA
ud8.7:2.6	“Nāgasamāla, this is the road,	NA
ud8.7:2.7	let us go this way.”	NA
ud8.7:2.8	Then Nāgasamāla put the Buddha’s bowl and robes down on the ground right there and left, saying,	NA
ud8.7:2.9	“Sir, here are your bowl and robes.”	NA
ud8.7:3.1	Then as Nāgasamāla was going down that road, he was set upon by bandits who struck him with fists and feet, broke his bowl, and tore up his outer robe.	NA
ud8.7:3.2	Then Nāgasamāla—with his bowl broken and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha and told him what had happened.	NA
ud8.7:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.7:5.1	“Walking together, dwelling as one,	NA
ud8.7:5.2	the knowledge master mixes with foolish folk.	NA
ud8.7:5.3	Knowing this, they give up wickedness,	NA
ud8.7:5.4	like a milk-drinking heron the water.”	NA
ud8.8:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 8.8	NA
ud8.8:0.2	With Visākhā	NA
ud8.8:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud8.8:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.	NA
ud8.8:1.3	Now at that time the dear and beloved granddaughter of Visākhā Migāra’s Mother had just passed away.	NA
ud8.8:1.4	Then, in the middle of the day, Visākhā with wet clothes and hair went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.	NA
ud8.8:1.5	The Buddha said to her,	NA
ud8.8:2.1	“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair?”	NA
ud8.8:2.2	“Sir, my beloved granddaughter has just passed away.	NA
ud8.8:2.3	That’s why I came here in the middle of the day with wet clothes and hair.”	NA
ud8.8:2.4	“Visākhā, would you like as many children and grandchildren as there are people in the whole of Sāvatthī?”	NA
ud8.8:2.5	“I would, sir.”	NA
ud8.8:3.1	“But Visākhā, how many people pass away each day in Sāvatthī?”	NA
ud8.8:3.2	“Every day, sir, there are ten people passing away in Sāvatthī.	NA
ud8.8:3.3	Or else there are nine,	NA
ud8.8:3.4	eight,	NA
ud8.8:3.5	seven,	NA
ud8.8:3.6	six,	NA
ud8.8:3.7	five,	NA
ud8.8:3.8	four,	NA
ud8.8:3.9	three,	NA
ud8.8:3.10	two,	NA
ud8.8:3.11	or at least one person who passes away every day in Sāvatthī.	NA
ud8.8:3.12	Sāvatthī is never without someone passing away.”	NA
ud8.8:4.1	“What do you think, Visākhā? Would there ever be a time when your clothes and hair were not wet?”	NA
ud8.8:4.2	“No, sir.	NA
ud8.8:4.3	Enough, sir, with so many children and grandchildren.”	NA
ud8.8:5.1	“Those who have a hundred loved ones, Visākhā, have a hundred sufferings.	NA
ud8.8:5.2	Those who have ninety loved ones,	NA
ud8.8:5.3	or eighty,	NA
ud8.8:5.4	seventy,	NA
ud8.8:5.5	sixty,	NA
ud8.8:5.6	fifty,	NA
ud8.8:5.7	forty,	NA
ud8.8:5.8	thirty,	NA
ud8.8:5.9	twenty,	NA
ud8.8:5.10	ten,	NA
ud8.8:5.11	nine,	NA
ud8.8:5.12	eight,	NA
ud8.8:5.13	seven,	NA
ud8.8:5.14	six,	NA
ud8.8:5.15	five,	NA
ud8.8:5.16	four,	NA
ud8.8:5.17	three,	NA
ud8.8:5.18	two,	NA
ud8.8:5.19	or one loved one have one suffering.	NA
ud8.8:5.20	Those who have no loved ones have no suffering. They are free of sorrow, stains, and anguish I say.”	NA
ud8.8:6.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.8:7.1	“All the sorrows and lamentations	NA
ud8.8:7.2	and the countless forms of suffering in the world	NA
ud8.8:7.3	occur because of those that we love;	NA
ud8.8:7.4	without loved ones they do not occur.	NA
ud8.8:8.1	That’s why those who have no loved ones <j>at all in the world	NA
ud8.8:8.2	are happy and free of grief.	NA
ud8.8:8.3	So aspiring to the sorrowless and stainless,	NA
ud8.8:8.4	have no loved ones in the world at all.”	NA
ud8.9:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 8.9	NA
ud8.9:0.2	With Dabba (1st)	NA
ud8.9:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud8.9:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.	NA
ud8.9:1.3	Then Venerable Dabba the Mallian went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:	NA
ud8.9:1.5	“Holy One, it is the time for my full extinguishment.”	NA
ud8.9:1.6	“Please, Dabba, do as you see fit.”	NA
ud8.9:2.1	Then Dabba rose from his seat, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in midair, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully extinguished.	NA
ud8.9:3.1	Then when he was fully quenched while sitting cross-legged in midair, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.	NA
ud8.9:3.2	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.	NA
ud8.9:4.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.9:5.1	“The body is broken up, perception has ceased,	NA
ud8.9:5.2	all feelings have become cool;	NA
ud8.9:5.3	choices are stilled,	NA
ud8.9:5.4	and consciousness come to an end.”	NA
ud8.10:0.1	Heartfelt Sayings 8.10	NA
ud8.10:0.2	Dabba (2nd)	NA
ud8.10:1.1	So I have heard.	NA
ud8.10:1.2	At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.	NA
ud8.10:1.3	There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,	NA
ud8.10:1.4	“Mendicants!”	NA
ud8.10:1.5	“Venerable sir,” they replied.	NA
ud8.10:1.6	The Buddha said this:	NA
ud8.10:2.1	“Mendicants, when Dabba the Mallian rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in midair, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully quenched, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.	NA
ud8.10:2.2	It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.	NA
ud8.10:2.3	In the same way, when Dabba the Mallian rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in midair, entered and withdrew from the fire element before becoming fully quenched, his body burning and combusting left neither ashes nor soot to be found.”	NA
ud8.10:3.1	Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:	NA
ud8.10:4.1	“Just as the glow of iron struck	NA
ud8.10:4.2	by a hammer in the fire of Jātaveda	NA
