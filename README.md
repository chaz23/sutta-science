# sutta-science

## Overview

This is a personal project to create easily accessible and sanitized datasets related to the Buddhist canon.

## Data

You can find all the data and the scripts I used to create them in the `./data` folder.  

Some datasets are just "raw data", like the translations of the Sutta Pitaka, while others involve some modelling such as text embeddings.

## Collaboration

If you'd like to collobarate (add data to this collection) just get in touch.

## Acknowledgements

This project draws mostly on the open-source data of [SuttaCentral](https://github.com/suttacentral).
